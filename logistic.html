        <p>Dubai, as the trading hub of the UAE, is at the crossroads
of world trade routes. From time immemorial, this
ambitious and enterprising emirate has been the meeting
point and the regional centre for traders across generations.
Hence, it is no wonder that one of the world’s leading names
in the global maritime industry was born out of Dubai. DP
World was formed in September 2005 with the integration of
the terminal operations of the Dubai Ports Authority (DPA),
which was focused on the UAE ports of Rashid and Jebel Ali,
and DPI (Dubai Ports International), which had been set up to
export this success internationally.</p>
<p>DP World’s experience dates back to the year 1999, when
DPI was established to apply its expertise to managing
ports in the Middle East, India and Europe. Its first project
was a collaboration at Jeddah Islamic Port (in 1999) on the
management and operation of the South Container Terminal
(SCT). In 2003, SCT was the first terminal in the country to
exceed 1 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent container
units). DPI .continued to expanding through successful
operations at the ports of Djibouti (2000), Vizag, India (2002)
and Constanta, Romania (2003).</p>
<p>In January 2005, DPI transformed its network with the
strategic acquisition of CSX World Terminals (CSX WT),
the international terminal business of CSX Corporation,
giving it a strong presence in Hong Kong, China, Australia,
Germany, Dominican Republic and Venezuela. In yet another
significant step, DP World also acquired CSX WT’s strong
project pipeline, which included the 9-berth Pusan Newport
(PNC), South Korea.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/dpworld-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>In February 2005, DP World signed an agreement with the Cochin Port Trust (CoPT) to construct, develop and
operate an international container transhipment terminal at
Vallarpadam, Kochi, India. Closer to home, in the same year,
it was awarded a 30-year concession to develop and operate
the container terminal at the Port of Fujairah, in the UAE. In
November that year it announced agreements to develop
new container terminals at Yarimca, Turkey and Qingdao,
China.</p> 
<p>DP World’s next giant leap forward came with the
acquisition of P&O in March 2006, expanding its portfolio of terminals and adding P&O Maritime Services to the group.
The combined container throughput of both companies for
2005 was more than 35 million TEU across terminals from
the Americas to Asia. This grew to nearly 42 million TEU in
2006. This deal made the company a top-three global port
operator and was an historic moment that formed the base
for further international growth over time with an aim to
achieve progress for all.</p>
<p>DP World is an apt example of the Dubai model of adding
services that go “beyond the gate” in response to shipping lines and shippers seeking
greater efficiencies across
the whole supply chain. Its
London Gateway project,
a prime example taking
this model global, is a port
centric logistics solution
with corridors into the
UK hinterland. The new
3.5 million TEU deep sea
container port located just
east of London on the north
bank of the Thames, due
to open in Q4 2013, has
the potential to transform
logistics operations in the
UK at the heart of the UK’s
largest consumer market –
the south east.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/dpworld-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>It is adjacent to what will
be the largest rail connected
logistics park development in Europe at some 9.25 million
square feet. The vast majority of deep sea imports enter
the UK through south east ports, yet only 10 per cent of
warehousing is in the region. By having these at the point
of entry DP World’s strategy will ensure that significant
significant supply chain savings are made through reduced
transport costs.</p>

	<p> On other continents, DP World has also developed a
container train to improve the connectivity between the
ports and hinterland in the Indian Subcontinent. It operates
a container freight station outside the port gates in Mundra
(India) and has invested in and operates inland depots in
northern Europe and Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>It has stayed true to its vision of sustainable value
through global growth, service and excellence with a firm
commitment to people, profitable global growth, responsible
corporate and individual behaviour as well as excellence and
innovation. Operating in multiple markets with different regulations brings unique challenges, which DP World
tackled with moves that matched its fast-paced growth. It
has consistently underlined its expansion through a series of
corporate responsibility (CSR) programs and has become an
integral part of the communities in which it operates.</p>
<p>Today, with more than 60 terminals across six continents
DP World and its companies are enablers of word trade,
connecting global markets and world economies. With an
average concession life of 43 years, it is a fundamental part
of the nations and communities where it is present, making
sustainability a way of life and a way of business. As the thirdlargest
port operator in the world, its team of 28,000 people
serves business and trade by providing multi-modal access
to global markets as a trusted and responsive partner to all
those involved in the supply chain.</p>

    <p>In 2012, DP World handled more than 56 million TEU
(twenty-foot equivalent container units) across its portfolio
from the Americas Asia. With a pipeline 11 new developments and major expansions underway in 9 countries including India,
Africa, Europe and the Middle East, capacity is expected to
rise to around 103 million TEU by 2020. The promising future
is also evident in the group’s strong financial performance. DP World’s profits for the year 2012 stood at USD 749 million
with revenue of USD 3,121 million, which was 5% ahead
compared to the previous year.</p>

   <b>Sailing ahead with Djibouti</b>
        
<p>DP World’s approach to business has always centred around long-term partnerships – with customers, business
partners and communities. Its investment in Djibouti over several years is an excellent example of this. Sitting at
the crossroads of some of the world’s main shipping lanes connecting Asia, Africa and Europe, Doraleh Container
Terminal (DCT) is a jewel in the crown of DP World’s Africa operations.</p>
<p>Foundations for the terminal were laid in 2000 when DP World and the Djiboutian Government established a joint
venture together, with DP World awarded a 20-year concession to operate the Port of Djibouti. That successful
partnership gave birth to the joint-venture that built Doraleh, which opened in 2008. Through its modern logistics
facilities and strategic location, Doraleh is well placed to become the premier container distribution hub for the
Sailing ahead with Djibouti
region. The terminal has an annual handling
capacity of 1.2 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent
units) the largest in East Africa with almost 50%
of containers handled destined for Ethiopia.</p>
<p>These physical assets are shaping Doraleh’s
future. Moreover, as a major employer in the
region with over 800 staff, close to 98 percent of
who are local, DP World engages directly with the
community. One of its initiative is a multi-purpose
community centre close to the port offering

   <b>Expanding with the fast-growing Indian economy</b>
        
<p>India is one of the fastest-growing emerging economies of the
world and DP World has been committed to supporting its growth
for more than a decade and is continuing it into the future. With
five terminals across the country, India is one of its most important
markets.</p>
<p>The Port of Nhava Sheva is a shining example of its investment in
India’s long term future, being part of the largest port in the country
at Jawaharlal Nehru Port, close to the commercial hub of Mumbai that
handles almost half of India’s maritime traffic. Starting operations in
1999 as the first private container terminal, Nhava Sheva is a major
gateway to the vast hinterland beyond its gates. Aside from links to
a wide network of inland container depots (ICD), the terminal is also
connected to India’s major highway and rail networks.</p>
<p>DP World’s plans on the anvil include investment of around USD 200
million to build a container terminal and 17 hectares of yard. The new
quay has been awarded a 17-year concession and will be equipped
with 4 rail mounted quay cranes and 12 rubber tyred gantry cranes.</p>
<p>Its investment in Nhava Sheva also takes other forms alongside new
equipment and construction. Keeping up its socially-responsible
partnerships, DP World is active in the local community with school
projects and environmental awareness campaigns. It also keeps
employee welfare high on the agenda with incentives to boost
productivity, continually enhanced safety awareness, sports events
and round-the-clock paramedic services on site.</p>

        <p>In a world that is reinventing ways and means to do
business, economic ingenuity is seeing a rapid increase.
The United Arab Emirates, and Dubai in particular, continue
to play a crucial role in the region by creating policies and
places that are conducive to successful business. These
are not just incubators for growth in the nation, but also a
benchmark for the wider world.</p>
<p>Showcasing the UAE’s approach, economic Zones World
(EZW), from its headquarters in Dubai, is exporting its
expertise and experience in forming hubs that generate
solid, lasting economic growth. EZW is the global provider
of sustainable industrial and logistics infrastructure solutions.
It is part of the global holding company Dubai World, which
focuses on the strategic growth areas of Transport & Logistics,
Drydocks & Maritime, Urban Development, Investment and
Financial Services.</p>

<p>EZW’s current portfolio includes Jafza, Gazeley,
TechnoPark and Dubai Auto Zone. As a group that strives to
enhance successes for people, places and economies, it has
been at the forefront of creating challenging and rewarding
environments. Its robust network of economic zones, technology, logistics and industrial parks as well as buildto-
suit developments across the world fulfil the objective
to support the dynamic expansion of its rapidly growing
international customer base. </p> 
<p>Jafza is EZW’s flagship operation and home to more
than 6,800 multinational companies, including over 120 of
the Global Fortune 500 enterprises. It is the region’s most
efficient logistics hub and the only one in the world located
between a top container terminal and a top international airport, enabling the best in multimodal connectivity. In its
26-year history through its pioneering project, the Jebel Ali
Free Zone, it is a brilliant example of the success of Dubai and
EZW’s strategic planning.</p>
<p>The free zone contributes 21 percent of Dubai’s GDP on
a year-to-year basis; accounts for more the 50 percent of
Dubai’s total exports; sustains the employment of more than
138,000 persons; and above all, accounts for 40 percent of
net FDI inflow into the UAE.</p>
    <p>Also in EZW portfolio is Gazeley, one of Europe’s
leading developers and providers of sustainable logistics
and industrial spaces. Gazeley has strong presence in
the UK, mainland Europe, China and India. Since 1987, it
has developed more than 60 million sq ft of sustainable
distribution warehouses and industrial space for leading
international companies and third-party logistics providers
worldwide.</p>

<p>Closer to home, TechnoPark is the EZW research and
development initiative in core economic sectors, including
energy, water and environment. It focuses on nurturing
business ideas and new technologies in various fields,
which could be quickly translated into real-world industrial
operations. This is a landmark project that symbolises
Dubai’s vision to develop a knowledge-based, technologycentric
sustainable business hub.</p>
<p>Further on, Dubai Auto Zone (DAZ) is a comprehensive
marketplace for the auto industry catering to buyers, sellers,
service providers, principals and traders. DAZ, a mixed use
facility, will consist of a free zone to attract Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) in the auto sector, a specialised economic
zone to cater to the GCC markets and a retail zone to serve
the local markets.</p>

<p>EZW has spread its wings far and wide with a presence
that spans from the Americas to Africa to Asia Pacific. In the USA, it is creating the first zone in the country, located
in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. Jafza Americas is
designing and developing the Orangeburg Industrial and
Logistics Park, which will support customers’ logistics,
distribution, assembly and light manufacturing needs in the
southeast United States.</p>
<p>The 1,322 acre site is to be developed in four stages over
the next 20 years as determined by market conditions. This
catalyst project is expected to create thousands of jobs by
bringing together immediate interstate access, reliable
utilities, a quality workforce and scalable real estate offerings
that will provide customers a location for growth and
profitability.</p>
<p>In Africa, EZW has one of the most centrally-located
destinations in the form of the Djibouti Free Zone, a project
that is leading its efforts in the Middle East & Africa (MEA)
region. While in the Asia Pacific, it is shaping the future of
key markets from its regional headquarters based in the city
of Shanghai, China. The group also has existing as well as
planned operations in thriving locations across India with an
aim to bring about multiple connectivity options as well as

   <b>Creating new opportunities in Asia Pacific</b>
        
<p>Asia Pacific, as one of the world’s leading exporting regions,
provides apt locations for EZW to introduce and grow its
offerings. Starting out early, the group has had a presence
for over five years in the Asia Pacific region and has been
leveraging its expansion rom its regional headquarters in
Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>EZW focuses primarily on the China market, offering facility

sustainable logistics facility developer. Its existing and
completed projects include Kunshan Logistics & Nanjing
Logistics Park in Jiangsu Province, Wal-Mart Tianjin
Distribution Centre, a 43,000 sq mt sustainable warehouse

43,000 sq mt sustainable warehouse in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Further on, Lembah Beringin in Kuala Lumpur is its
upcoming 1250-acre project, providing a national and
regional road distribution hub for Malaysia. Additionally,
in India, another key Asian destination, EZW has plans
to provide customers a mix of large- and mediumsized
warehouses and is targeting developments in the
metropolises of Chennai, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata,
Nagpur, Cochin and Hyderabad.</p>

   <b>The gateway to growth in Africa</b>
        
<p>Aptly named the gateway to East Africa, the Djibouti Free
Zone is one of the single most important strategic port and
logistics operations to the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) & the US. EZW’s maiden project
in this nation, it is located on the horn of the continent and is
responsible for the majority of trade from Europe, Asia and
the rest of Africa.</p>
<p>Jafza has been at the forefront of this successful project,
entirely managing the Free Zone thus ensuring its strategic
and financial success. With extensive knowledge of what
makes a business hub flourish, Jafza has implemented its
international best practices by attracting corporations from
across the globe with favourable investment, start up and
work policies, not to mention a state-of-the-art logistics and
communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>Developed on a 40-hectare plot, DFZ offers office units,
warehouses, light industrial units and plots sized between
2,000 to 15,000 sq mt to investors. Followings 100 percent
occupation of Phase I of EZW’s Djibouti Free Zone (DFZ), it
launched Phase II of the project comprising the development
of light industrial units, warehouses and office facilities.</p>
<p>EZW has been a major partner in the development of the
country’s infrastructure, operating and managing a number
of projects that have significantly contributed to Djibouti’s
socio-economic growth. Together with its sister organisation, DP World, which manages Djibouti Port, and now the Doraleh Container Terminal and Djibouti International
Airport, it has been a part of the nation’s remarkable development.</p>
<p>Today, Djibouti Ports and the Free Zone together account for more than half of the country’s GDP. Its significance
can be gauged by the fact that since the launch of DFZ, Djibouti’s real GDP growth in percentage terms has
jumped from 3% in 2005 to almost 7% in 2008.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>In 1976, Gulftainer Company Limited was established in
the emirate of Sharjah with a primary role to manage and
operate the container terminals of Sharjah’s ports on behalf
of Sharjah Port Authority. Gulftainer started its operations
in Port Khalid, the main port of Sharjah and subsequently
in 1986 Khorfakkan Port, a coastal city on the Arabian Gulf.
Since then, the company has been playing an important role
in increasing the activity of exports and imports via sea which
has resulted in steadily economic growth in the emirate and
in the UAE in general.</p>
<p>Over the decades, Gulftainer has set its vision of becoming
a globally-recognized terminals operator and determined the
pillars of success by seizing the opportunities that opened
the doors for the company to fly higher. In 2009, a 5-year
contract was signed with the international plastics company,
Borouge, boosting Gulftainer’s presence in the local market.
Gulftainer, as per the contract, is to provide Borouge with
on-site cargo handling, packaging and logistics services
at its polyolefin’s plant in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi. The size of
operations is expected to expand since Borouge is increasing
the capacity of its polyolefin’s plant. Now, Gulftainer is
the second largest ports operator and the largest privately
owned port operator in the world.</p>
<p>Momentum Logistics, the 3rd party logistics provider – a
part of the Gulftainer group, has been providing a wide range
of logistics services since 2008 throughout the UAE and
region with rapidly growing activity in Iraq in recent years.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/gulftain-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
<p>The vision of being global did not only drive Gulftainer to
take its operations beyond the UAE but it has also allowed it
to think unconventionally by expanding its services’ base and
stepping into other segments. In mid-2010, it tied-up with
Avalon, an inland transportation services provider. As a result
of this strategic tie-up, the number of trailers and trucks has
dramatically increased. In addition, the year of 2010 has also witnessed a geographic market expansion with signing
a joint venture with the Pak Shaheen Group of Pakistan to
supply inland logistics and cargo transportation in Pakistan.
Since then, the company’s wheel of achievements in the
international arena started spinning. Gulftainer was awarded
the concessions to operate Berth 8 “the Iraq Project Terminal
(IPT)” in South Port of Umm Qasr. It was also awarded to
complete the construction of and develop and operate
Berths 10 & 11 ‘The Iraq Container Terminal’ (ICT).</p>
<p>The company has taken its advanced operations
management beyond the GCC countries: Lebanon, Turkey,
Russia and Brazil. In November 2012, Gulftainer was awarded
the concession to develop and operate a new container
terminal at the Port of Tripoli, Lebanon. The concession will
last for 25 years and start with an investment of over than
USD 60 million in new equipment and machinery. Once
completed, the new terminal will be able to accommodate
some of the largest container vessels operating in the Eastern
Mediterranean, alleviating congestion at the Port of Beirut
and providing an alternative to the beleaguered ports of
Tartous and Latakia in Syria. This project will provide at least
300 new jobs and as well as stimulate the economic growth
in the area.</p> 
<p>Penetrating the BRICs markets is an obvious objective
of the UAE-based global prominent player. The strong
commitment of Gulftainer to become a major global port operator resulted in establishing its Brazilian venture in 2011
in order to facilitate a major concession to operate the Port
of Recife, located in the North East of Brazil. The company
has received great interests of major lines to use its services
in this port.</p> 

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/gulftain-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>The growth was not only evident in the number of
terminals developed and operated by the company but
also in the number of shipping lines that call at Gulftainer’s
ports. United Arab Shipping Company (UASC), CMA-CGM,
CSAV, Hanjin, Sea Consortium, China Shipping, Hapag
Lloyd, American President Lines (APL), MAG Container Lines,
Maersk Line, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and
Ethiopian Shipping Line are a few examples of these major
shipping lines.</p>
<p>Gulftainer has handled 4 million TEUs, or twenty-foot
equivalent units, in 2011, of which 3.3 million TEUs was in
the UAE, a 7% increase compared to 2010. This number will
definitely increase since the company eyes more acquisitions
in the Gulf, Asia, Africa and South America.</p>
<p>Gulftainer’s evident success in the international market
through the successive acquisitions and the increasing
number of operations and services offered is not only
attributed to the company’s foresighted vision and bright
management but also to the local market that efficiently
incubated the company and set up the platform of its take-off
towards internationalism.</p>

   <b>Expanding Global Footprint into the Dynamic Region of Russia</b>
        
<p>In September 2011, Gulftainer has successfully expanded its global footprint into the most dynamic Russian
maritime market through investing up to USD 270 million to co-develop and operate Ust-Luga port in Russia’s
Baltic region. Being the largest UAE private company investment deal in Russia, the UAE-based company has
demonstrated a strong confident on the commercial potential of the Russian market. Ust-Luga is strategically
located as a gateway into the heart of Russia’s buoyant Baltic Western region. The volume of container traffic,
through the Baltic, has risen dramatically in recent years but the scope for growth is high, as the ratio of containers
handled to population is still only 30 per 1000 people in Russia compared with 168 per 1000 in the EU. In addition,
it will play a significant role as an alternative port, reducing the increasing congestion on St. Petersburg Port.</p>
<p>Gulftainer has previously signed a major joint venture with Prominvest, the financial and investment arm of Russian
State Corporation, Russian Technologies. The new Joint Venture Company, Gulftainer Russian Technologies was
established to pursue investments and management opportunities in the complete logistics chain within the
Russian Federation and the rest of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) including strategic port assets
and related infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Drydocks World is one of the solid examples of what
forward thinking and far sighted planning can achieve,
especially for an ever growing emirate like Dubai. The
original idea of Dubai Drydocks started in 1973 when the
late ruler HH Sheikh Rashid Bin Said Al Maktoum decided to
establish a shipyard to provide the busy marine traffic lines in
the Arabian Gulf with a platform for maintenance and repair.
The shipyard grew to become one of the largest in the world,
with an annual capacity of over 350 vessels, most of them
ULCCs (Ultra Large Crude Carriers) and VLCCs (Very Large
Crude Carriers).</p>
<p>Through its shipyards in Dubai, Indonesia and Singapore,
Drydocks World has become a global key player in ship repair
and rig upgrade, conversion and new building. The Dubai
facility, one of the first and largest shipyards in the Middle
East, has received vessels of all sizes and shapes, ranging
from the smallest fishing boat to the largest ULCC from over
40 different countries. It has one of the largest graving docks
in the world at 521 m x 100m, capable of accommodating a
vessel of half a million dead weight. In 2003, Dubai yard built
and delivered a 14,500 tons floating dock for Saudi Aramco,
enhancing its role in the region.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>In mid-2007, a world-wide expansion program was started.
In April 2008, Drydocks World acquired Pan United Marine
that owns multiple shipyards in Singapore and Indonesia. As
a result, Drydocks World – South East Asia was established.
The ‘One Integrated Company’ slogan was initiated and
propagated recently. The new huge facility comprises 4
shipyards. Singapore yard is involved in repair, conversion
and new building. The company also has yards in Pertama, Graha and Nanindah in Indonesia. Its yard in Pertama is
involved in ship repair, conversion and new building. The
yard in Nanindah is a volume shipbuilding yard and has
constructed over 75 Offshore Support Vessels, whereas the
shipyard in Graha is a dedicated rig building yard and has
successfully completed several projects.</p>
<p>The operations in South East Asia bring together
well-established offshore rig construction, shipbuilding,
conversion and ship repair expertise located at crossroads
of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and close to major
offshore Oil and Gas field developments. This company is
growingly becoming an interesting asset of Drydocks World,
especially with the increasing demand for its services in the
South East Asia region. The company employs around 10,000
employees from 52 countries. </p>

    <p>The success Drydocks World has achieved locally and
internationally is not attributed to one factor. The UAE
business-friendly environment that made it easy for international companies to cooperate with Drydocks World,
the dedicated workforce with an accumulating expertise and
the strategic locations of the shipyards as the crossroads of
the busiest routes in the world and the diversity employment
strategy followed are some of the success pillars that enabled
the company to grow and become a leader in its field.</p>

   <b>Investing in strategic yards</b>
        
<p>Committed to its vision of becoming a world leading
ship repair, ship building, maritime cluster and offshore
organization, Drydocks World has entered into a global
strategic alliance with the Singaporean Kuok Group in
2010 to form a joint venture with Pacific Carriers Limited,
a highly recognized international name in the shipping
industry. As a result, the new venture has been renamed
Drydocks World - PaxOcean Asia Pte Ltd. However, it kept
its headquarters in Singapore. Activities at the shipyards
include offshore, shipbuilding, repair and conversion.</p>
<p>Since then, Drydocks World and its partner Kuok Group
have gathered their efforts to support DDW-PaxOcean
Asia into becoming a leading maritime service provider in
the region. Drydocks World views the Asia Pacific region
as a place where it can grow faster and will continue to
invest in this growing market.</p>

        <p>The most prominent feature of UAE-based companies
is how each displays the same traits of ambition and
diversified growth that the nation is built on. Most of these
enterprises have grown to become conglomerates that have
not become prominent harbingers of progress in the wider
region. In many ways, the traditions of trading and shipping
are common across several of the Middle East nations.
Upholding this tradition, while going beyond is Sharaf Group,
a name that entered the business world in the year 1975.</p>
<p>Starting out with just US$ 50,000 in cash, the pioneering
approach of its leadership gave birth to one of the Gulf’s
largest conglomerates with a diversified portfolio of
companies and investments ranging from real estate to
shipping to and beyond. Headquartered in Dubai, Sharaf
Group at present comprises over 60 member companies
in more than eight business sectors. As one of largest
business conglomerates, the group has sustained growth
through leveraging the opportunities of the UAE’s diversified
economy. Its business activities are focused on forming a
strong presence within the Middle East, Africa and South
Asia regions. Having started out as a trading business house,
it has always laid emphasis on reliability and product delivery
in every venture.</p>

    <img src="images/sharafg-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>In the financial sector, the group has two strong entities,
namely Central Exchange, its wholly-owned currency
exchange house and Mac Sharaf Securities, a brokerage firm
formed in partnership with the Hong Kong-based McMillen
Advantage Capital and the Dubai-based Al Ali Group. One
of its strongest areas of expertise is general trading and
the group has several well-known names to its credit in this field including Sharaf Retail, Sharaf DG and Sharaf Digital,
offering Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances as well
as Sharaf AG and Yellow Hat Japan, its retail stores focused
on the automotive sector.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, the group has a praiseworthy presence in
the manufacturing and industrial field with nine different
companies encompassing a wide range of units from
processing to furniture and cement to yachts. Keeping pace
with the modern world, it started Information Dynamic,
which specialises in meeting the IT needs of the Shipping,
Retail, Logistics and Travel and Aviation companies. From
establishment in the year 1995, the firm today has a strong
overseas presence along with a customer base in over 33
