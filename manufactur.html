        <p>As one of the most prolific metal on earth, aluminium
has seen a formidable rise in application since the
mid-19th century. Its high conductivity and resistance to rust
made it an extensively used metal and more recently, the
largest contract traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
No wonder then that metals in general, and aluminium
specifically, take centre-stage in the diversification of Abu
Dhabi’s industrial base in line with the emirate’s Economic
Vision 2030. Playing a major role in the realisation of these
goals is Emirates Aluminium (EMAL), a Joint Venture (JV)
between Mubadala Development Company (Mubadala) and
Dubai Aluminium Company Limited (DUBAL).</p>
<p> EMAL is a state-of-the-art aluminium smelter complex,
located at KIZAD (Khalifa Industrial Zone – Abu Dhabi) in Al
Taweelah, strategically located halfway between Abu Dhabi
and Dubai. It showcases the close cooperation between the
two emirates in the UAE, aimed at diversifying the nation’s
economy and ensuring its continued vibrancy in the future.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/emal-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>EMAL’s advanced smelter currently uses DUBAL’s DX
Reduction Cell Technology to produce 750,000 tonnes of
aluminium annually. This is slated to increase to 1.3 metric
million tonnes by the end of 2014 upon completion of
Phase II. Further on, the installation of the new generation
DX+ Reduction Cell Technology and this projected increase
in capacity will make EMAL one of the largest single-site
producers of primary aluminium in the world.</p>

	<p>Its aluminium complex is to be built in two phases on a 6
sq km site in KIZAD, an ambitious development that aims
to be the regional hub for industrial manufacturing. Phase
I of the EMAL smelter commenced operations on the 2nd
of December 2009 and hit full production capacity on first
workday of 2011. Its product mix comprises sow, standard ingots, sheet ingots and extrusion billets, two of which are
traded on the London Metals Exchange (LME).</p>
<p> USD 5.7 billion was invested to build EMAL Phase I with
an on-going USD 4.5 billion investment in Phase II of the
smelter’s development, which started in 2011 and is on
path to be completed in 2014. Today, these remarkable
achievements have made EMAL one of the largest industrial
projects in the UAE outside the oil & gas sector.</p>
<p>It achieved these with a purpose-built wharf at Khalifa
Port to receive shipments of raw materials directly to the
smelter and put in place an on-site gas-fired 2,000 MW
power plant for reliable long-term energy supply. The results
manifested rapidly through remarkable growth figures with
EMAL currently supplying over 150 customer worldwide. </p> 


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/emal-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Its high quality aluminium, available in different formats, has high standards and certifications maintained throughout
the manufacturing line. Furthermore, the power plant at
the site will see a planned increase to 3,000MW by 2014.
The economic challenge for any smelter is in designing
and implementing technology to get the highest quality
product using minimal electricity consumption. EMAL does
this by utilising the most sustainable technologies available
worldwide to reduce emissions in line with Environment
Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) requirements to minimise its
carbon footprint.</p>
<p> Its operational workforce currently provides direct
employment for approximately 2,000 people, which is set
to rise to 3,000 by 2014. The company has been consistently
recognised for its achievements with several commendations
including the prestigious DuPont Safety Award, GCC Industrial Project of the Year 2012 by MEED, and Dubai’s
KAIZEN Gold Award on the occasion of World Quality Day.</p>
<p> From day one, EMAL has placed priority on its
commitment to environment, community, safety and best
practices. EMAL’s stance on the environment is underlined by
a USD 200 million contract for the supply of its gas treatment
centres (GTCs). The deal secures its best-practice technology
to reduce both fluoride and sulphur dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>Further to this, EMAL’s power plant uses the cooling tower
technology to reduce the temperature of the water used
during the energy production process, which in turn helps
safeguard the delicate marine eco-system of Al Taweelah.
In addition, it also conducted a major wildlife translocation exercise in conjunction with the Environment Agency – Abu
Dhabi (EAD) prior to starting Phase I construction. In terms of
safety, EMAL achieved 5 million work hours without a single
Lost Time Incident (LTI).</p>

<p>When it comes to developmental initiatives, EMAL has
Emiratisation of the workforce at the core of its business
development strategy. It enables opportunities through
graduate trainee programs, technical trainings, and
scholarships for local graduates with guaranteed jobs. Its
engagement also involves open days for the local community
and support for social, sports and cultural organisations as
well as donations to charitable health organisations.</p>

   <b>EMAL listed on London metal exchange</b>
        
<p>Established for over 130 years and located in the heart of London, the London Metals Exchange (LME) is the world
centre for trading of industrial metals with more than 80% of all non-ferrous metal futures business transacted on
its platforms. Investors value the LME not just as a vibrant futures exchange, but also for its close links to industry.
EMAL placed emphasis on making a mark on the global stage from its early days and LME was the platform that
it has set its sights on. The LME standards for product listing are among the most robust that including ISO 9001
certification and completion a full year of production.</p>
<p>In light of these quality checks, EMAL stood apart through its significant achievement of listing sow, a solid block
of molten aluminium, with LME exactly one year after its smelter began producing the same. This accomplishment
enabled it to ensure both consistent pricing and an international standard of quality. Further to this strategic
move, EMAL also listed its standard ingot product on the exchange, thus sealing its reputation as a global business
attracting customers around the world.</p>

   <b>Foresighted upsurge of market-share in Europe</b>
        
<p>Global demand for aluminium for 2011 was estimated at 44 million metric tonnes and is projected to rise to 70
million metric tonnes by 2020. Amongst the different regions, the European Union (EU) as a whole imports
approximately 60% of its primary aluminium requirements, thus offering excellent prospects for future market
share.</p>
<p>EMAL’s robust global export plan placed emphasis on local, Middle Eastern, European, Asian and North American
markets. Having achieved a significant customer base in Asia, it directed its focus on the European market to
capitalise on the growing demand.
Putting its strategy to work in the year 2011, EMAL exported 174,000 metric tonnes of aluminium to Europe and
is expected to increase by 35% in 2013.
The year 2011 was a landmark year for EMAL in many more ways as it hit the symbolic mark of one million metric
tonnes of hot metal produced and also announced of the start of phase II. Currently, approximately 88 to 92
percent of aluminium produced in the UAE is exported to global markets and EMAL continues to be one of the
two major producers of this metal in the nation.</p>

        <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), an UAEbased
oil and gas company, and Borealis, an Austriabased
provider of chemical and plastics solutions, established
Borouge as a joint venture in 1998. Within a few years of
operation, Borouge became a leading provider of innovative,
value creating plastics solutions.</p>
<p>Borouge consists of two separate companies: the Abu
Dhabi Polymers Company (Borouge’s Production Company)
headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and Borouge Pte Ltd
(Borouge’s Marketing & Sales Company) with the head
office in Singapore and three logistics hubs in Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Singapore.</p>
<p>Borouge is an excellent example of a petrochemicals
company that is experiencing formidable growth within an
incredible short period of time. Its journey of success was
evident through the increasing number of the manufacturing
plants. At the beginning, the company distributed Borealis
plastics products through its sales and marketing units in
different countries, a strategic move to best research the
market and test the water of the industry. Once the potential
was realized, building its own manufacturing plants was a
logical next step.</p>

<p>The company started production at its first plant in Ruwais,
Abu Dhabi in 2001 with a capacity of 450,000 tonnes per
year (t/y) of polyethylene. In 2002, the first shipments of
polyethylene left the Abu Dhabi plant to customers in the
Middle East and Asia. By 2005, the company’s state-of-theart
petrochemicals complex was expanded to manufacture
a total of 600,000 tonnes of polyethylene per year. The complex consisted of an ethylene cracker and two Borstar®
bimodal polyethylene units, each capable of producing
300,000 t/y of bimodal polyethylene.</p> 
<p>In 2010, and as per its growth plans to strengthen its
presence in the petrochemicals industry to meet the
ever-increasing demand, the company tripled its annual
production capacity in Abu Dhabi to 2 million tonnes
per year, including polypropylene for the first time. The
expansion in capacity was achieved under the multi-billion
dollar ‘Borouge 2 Project’. The expansion project included
an additional ethane cracker, a third polyethylene unit, an
olefins conversion unit for the conversion of ethylene to
propylene and two new polypropylene units, spearheading
the company’s entrance into polypropylene production.</p>
<p>Stepping into the Chinese giant market to support the
challenges and demands of China and Asia’s rapidly growing
industries in April 2010 through inaugurating a compounding
manufacturing unit in Shanghai was a milestone that signals
the strong commitment of the company to be among the
global industry players.</p>
<p>With the scope of its customers expanding in Asia,
Borouge aims to be a leading plastics supplier to China in its
strategic market segments of infrastructure, automotive and
advanced packaging. The company has boosted its presence
in China with launching {two logistic hubs and an academy
Wire & Cable.</p>

    <p>Unique proprietary processes
and catalyst technologies like
Borstar and Borealis Nucleation
Technology (BNT) that were
adapted enabled Borouge
to provide a differentiated
range of polyethylene and
polypropylene innovative,
value creating plastics solutions
for infrastructure (including
pipe systems, and power
and communication cables),
automotives and advanced
packaging.</p>
<p>In addition, being present
in key strategic locations
throughout the Middle
East, Asia-Pacific and Africa
facilitates speed to market,
on-time delivery and customer
support. Borouge is also the
exclusive regional provider of
the entire Borealis product line.</p>
<p>With its base in the UAE
and marketing & sales head
office in Singapore, Borouge
employs approximately 1,700
people representing more than
40 nationalities and serving
customers in more than 50
countries across the Middle
East, Asia-Pacific, Indian sub-continent and Africa.</p>
<p>Driven by its growth strategy and committing to meet the
needs of its increasing customers for high quality products
of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), Borouge is
currently expanding its polyolefin operations under the
‘Borouge 3 Expansion Project’ which will be completed at the
end of 2013 resulting in an additional capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per year (t/y) being fully operational by mid-2014. The
project includes an ethane cracker, two polyethylene units
and two polypropylene units as well as a LDPE unit. Having
entered the execution phase, 70% of the construction works
at the Borouge 3 Project have been completed.</p>

    <p>The company is also investing in plants and logistics hubs
in Asia and an innovation centre in Abu Dhabi. The centre will focus on innovations for compounding as well as innovative
plastics solutions in close cooperation with other local and
international educational institutes and partnership with
Borouge’s customers throughout the value chain. It came to
support the company’s manufacturing facilities and focus on
providing its customers with unique and innovative solutions
that ensure durability, cost effectiveness, material saving, environmentally friendly and sustainability.</p>

   <b>Shanghai plant filing Borouge’s first patent of polypropylene solution</b>
        
<p>As a company focused on value creation through innovation,
Borouge achieved a new step change in innovation by filing its
first patent application in polypropylene (PP), a testament to its
increasing capability in sales, marketing, product development and
IPR protection.</p>
<p>Borouge’s first patent filed on May 22, 2012, involves a new PP blend
that is used in appliances such as air conditioner parts. This PP
blend is recognized with its reduced weight comparing to polymer
materials conventionally used for the same purposes and without the
need to cut new mould as shrinkage is very similar. The patented PP solution was made at Borouge’s Compounding Manufacturing Plant (CMP) in Shanghai and is used to replace
Acrylonitrile Styrene (AS) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) resins enabling the company to target a new
area of PP applications.</p>
<p>The IPR protection Borouge has secured through filing its new patent would help enhance the innovativexs
capabilities of the Company’s product development. It would also support the company’s marketing and sales
activities, as well as the production of sustainable innovative PP solutions in China.</p>
<p>With the completion of the Borouge Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi later this year, Borouge will be able to move a
further step in innovation by producing more innovative solutions for the infrastructure, automotive and advanced
packaging industries in close cooperation and partnership with Borouge’s customers throughout the value chain.
Innovation will remain the main engine that drives Borouge towards ‘Shaping the Future with Plastics’.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>The late H. H. Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum,
vice-president and prime minister of the UAE and Emir
of Dubai (1958 – 1990), was among the early believers in
transforming the UAE’s economy from an oil-based economy
to a diversified economy by investing the wealth generated
from the country’s oil resources in establishing the first-ofits-
kind companies in each vital sector. Dubai Aluminium –
Dubal – was founded in 1975 as an implementation of that
vision. It was established as an aluminum manufacturer even
though a downstream aluminium industry had not yet been
established in the UAE. Thus, the company was founded to
be international from day one.</p>
<p>At that time, Dubal was among the biggest basic industry
development projects in the world. In November 1979, the
first metal was produced; and in January 1980 commercial
production began. Dubal’s plant comprised 360 reduction
cells in three potlines with the capacity to produce 135,000
tonnes per annum, all of which was exported directly to the
international market, initially mainly to the Far East and
ASEAN region. In 1996, its metal had been shipped to the
European market.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/dubal-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Today, after a series of successive expansion projects
completed between 1991 and 2008, Dubal operates the
world’s largest single-site primary aluminium smelter – in
Jebel Ali – using pre-bake anode technology. Its facilities have
grown to comprise a one million tonne per annum smelter
(1,537 reduction cells in seven potlines), casting operations
with the capacity to produce more than one million tonnes of
cast products per annum in three main forms (foundry alloy, billets and high purity aluminium), a large carbon plant, a
2,350 MW power plant, port, storage and other facilities. In
2012, it produced 1,025,266 tonnes.</p>
<p> The company did succeed in exporting aluminum products
to the world but also yielded distilled and potable water
for its own needs and for the greater Dubai community by
operating a 30 million imperial gallon per day desalination
plant. </p> 
<p>The growth of Dubal has been driven by a strategy
focused primarily on organic growth. Since 2007, Dubal has
begun to invest in core business opportunities where Dubal’s
technical know-how and aluminium smelting expertise can
be leveraged. The most significant development in this
regard is Emirates Aluminium (Emal) at Al Taweelah, Abu
Dhabi, in which Dubal has a 50 per cent share. Energizing of
the 756 reduction cells in EMAL Phase I, with a total capacity
of 750,000 tonnes per annum (since upgraded to 800,000
tonnes per annum), took place between 1 December 2009
and 31 December 2010 — with full production being reached
four months ahead of schedule, yet within budget. Emal
Phase II was announced in July 2011. A new 444-cell potline
is being built which will increase Emal’s annual production
capacity to 1.3 millon tonnes by the end of 2014. This will
fulfill the overall objective of the development, which is to
become one of the largest single-site producers of primary
aluminium in the world.</p>
<p>With a view to securing part of its alumina requirements,
Dubal has also made investments in green-field bauxite/
alumina projects that are in various stages of development.
These projects are in Republic of Guinea in a joint venture with BHP Billiton, Global Alumina and Mubadala; Brazil in
partnership with Norsk Hydro; and Cameroon with Hindalco
and Hydromine. Dubal has also acquired a share in a calcined
petroleum coke (CPC) development in China, thereby
securing part of its CPC requirements.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of Dubal’s growing involvement in
regional markets and to strengthen its brand internationally,
offices have been established in Italy, South Korea,
Switzerland and the USA.</p>
<p>In addition, Dubal is becoming a respected developer of
advanced reduction cell technologies, following more than
25 years of efforts to develop its own smelting technology
that can compete with similar technologies in the world
market in terms of productivity, capacity and efficiency,
while maintaining the highest standards of environmental
conservation. These efforts have culminated most recently in
two proprietary technologies.</p>

<p>DX Technology, where a demonstration line of 40 pots
has operated at DUBAL’s Jebel Ali site since February 2008
and the operating amperage has increased from 340 kA to
380 kA, offering several benchmark attributes that provide
significant advantages. DX Technology has been deployed in
the 756 cells at EMAL Phase I.</p>
<p>DX+ Technology, an advanced version of DX Technology,
where five new generation cells built in DUBAL’s pilot line
have operated stably since August 2010, and the operating
amperage has increased from 420 kA to 440 kA. DX+
Technology has been licensed to EMAL Phase II; and selected
by Aluminium Bahrain for its Line 6 Bankable Feasibility
study.</p>

   <b>Securing Growth</b>
        
<p>Driven by its vision to be among the world’s top five primary aluminium
producers by 2015, Dubal has made investments in important greenalumina
projects around the globe. In 2009, a joint venture with Norsk
Hydro of Norway and Dubal was formed to build an alumina refinery
‘Companhia Alumina do Pará’ (“CAP”), in Brazil close to Alunorte refinery –
the biggest in the world. Through these investments, Dubal aims to secure
the raw materials required to fuel its future growth strategy.</p>
<p>The CAP refinery will have an initial capacity of 1.86 metric tonnes per
annum through two lines, each one of 930,000 tons per year. The refinery’s
capacity is expandable to 7.4 metric tonnes. DUBAL holds 19 per cent
equity in the joint venture and additionally has secured 200,000 metric
tonnes commercial alumina off-take for four years from Norsk Hydro.</p>

        <p>On 24 November 1979, Dubai Cable Company “Ducab”
legacy began with a single manufacturing factory
in Jebel Ali Free Zone. The company is jointly owned by the
Governments of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Thanks to the immense developmental activities
undertaken at the Jebel Ali Free Zone, Ducab today enjoys a
plethora of utility services and technical prowess. It has one
of the most modern manufacturing units in the region and
occupies an area of 590,000 square meters of land in Jebel Ali,
Dubai and nearly 330,000 square meters in Mussafah, Abu
Dhabi spread over 2 factories.</p>
<p>More than 115,000 copper tones equivalent of low voltage,
medium and high voltage cables can be produced by Ducab’s
plants. The company is emerging as the leader and the first
choice of prestigious customers in the Middle East. The
diversity of its products’ range has greatly contributed to
the continuous growth and attracted a variety of clients
locally and internationally. Currently, high voltage cables up
to 400kV, medium voltage cables up to 33kV, low voltage
power cables, control & auxiliary, wiring and lead-sheathed
cables, low smoke and fume cables, cable components and
accessories, as well as copper rod are the main products of
Ducab.</p>

<p>Ducab was established to be an international company.
Penetrating new markets and selling across regional markets
are always within its strategy.</p>
<p>One of Ducab’s first international successes came when it
secured a USD 3 million fire resistance cable delivery contract
with the Delhi Metro, India in 2004. Ducab’s technical team
successfully developed a range of fire-resistant (FR) cables that could withstand temperatures of 950° C for three hours
surpassing the Delhi Metro project’s requirement of 750° C.
The company will continue investing in India as it is a very
promising market for cables manufacturers, given the large
scale investment in infrastructural development.</p>
<p>In 2011, as a strategic step to increase its industrial
capabilities and diversify its product lines, Ducab launched
Ducab HV, a joint venture with the local water and electricity
authorities in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The newly formed
venture came to offer Extra High Voltage infrastructural
products (up to 400 kv) to markets in the GCC and beyond.</p>
<p>As a remarkable milestone, Ducab HV signed a USD 13.5
million contract to supply the Ministry of Electricity and
Water (MEW) of Kuwait with 112 km of high voltage cables,
the first contract signed for the export of the high voltage
cables manufactured by Ducab’s new factory which was
inaugurated in November 2011. The Ducab HV has already
started providing the MEW in Kuwait with world-class high
voltage cables of 132 kV and a diameter of 630 mm, which
would require approximately 900 tonnes of copper. </p> 
<p>As it moves to service international markets, focusing on
traditional strengths of customer service and product quality
will continue to drive the sale of UAE manufactured cables
and allied products across the globe.</p>
<p>Given the undisputable quality of its cables, Ducab has
been sought-after for high-performance cables for landmark projects locally and internationally. Some of its leading
projects in the UAE include Burj Khalifa, Dubai Metro, Burj Al
Arab, Atlantis, and Dubai International Airport.</p>
<p>Within the GCC, DUCAB has been involved in numerous
major projects like the RAS Gas Project in Qatar, Al Manah
Power Station in Oman, Bahrain City Centre and Bahrain
Financial Harbour in Bahrain as well as the Kuwait National
Petroleum Company in Kuwait.</p>

    <img src="images/ducab-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Its commitment to quality and stringent testing procedures
and its ardently belief in human capital development are
what differentiate Ducab from its competitors. Cumulatively,
Ducab’s team has over 10,000 years of cables & wires
experience – a stunning figure. It has one of the lowest
employee turnover rates in the region, which is testament
to its ability to find, train and retain the best talent while
ensuring they develop along with the organization.</p>
<p>Ducab’s success has been attested by accreditations and
recognitions. The company has won a plethora of awards,
including MRM-Manufacturing Excellence, ESMA- Quality
Mark, ICD- Best Economic Value Creation. In addition, it has
been recognized as a Superbrand four consecutive times,
winning the Award in 2009, 2010, 2011 and now in 2012. In
2009, it was also honoured with the Mohammed Bin Rashid
Business Excellence Award for their achievements in the
manufacturing sector.</p>

   <b>Ducab’s footprints in promising asia</b>
        
<p>Asia is the largest infrastructure projects’ market in the world. This placement has been attracting the different
industries from the globe especially manufacturing companies. Dubai Cable Company, a cable manufacturing
company, has succeeded to strongly present itself in different countries in the Asian Continent, proving itself as
an international leader in this sector.</p>
<p>Aside from its engagement in prestigious projects in the GCC, Ducab supplied the Public Utility Board in Singapore
with low and medium voltage cables in 1993. This was the largest single order at that time. In 2004, the company
delivered the Delhi Metro project in India with fire performance resistant cables. The USD 3 million contract came
after a long and stringent evaluation process.</p>
<p>The company succeeded to win large-scale projects in Hong Kong. International Commerce Centre Tower and
HSBC Corporate Office were supplied with high quality cables by Ducab. Over the next few years, Ducab plans to
expand its manufacturing presence to some of key regional markets to ensure proximity to its customers.</p>

        <p>It was the year 1959 when the Dubai Refreshments
Company (DRC) was incorporated in Dubai in 1959 by a
Decree of His Highness, the Ruler of Dubai. This move was
momentous as it was the first company to introduce soft
drink manufacturing in the UAE. Over the decades, DRC has
seen significant expansion of its operations, becoming one
of the largest bottlers in the region and exporting to nations
beyond.</p>
<p>The company is headquartered in Dubai, UAE where its
current plant operates, providing it a strategically beneficial
location as to efficiently target all its key local markets, while
taking advantage of Dubai’s position as a major regional port
in order to maximise its export business. DRC holds exclusive
bottling rights for a broad portfolio of products under the
agreement with PepsiCo.</p>
<p>Working together with PepsiCo, it has been a crucial
partner in developing a strong brand identity as well as
loyalty for Pepsi in the UAE, which is evidenced in the strong
market share position of its products. DRC also differentiates
itself through its ongoing commitment to excellence in
customer service and in maintaining mutually beneficial
relationships with all its stakeholders.</p>

<p>The emergence of the UAE as a regional hub for trade
and commerce has been a driving force underpinning DRC’s
success. As Dubai and the UAE have grown and developed,
so too has DRC’s local customer base and ability to access
export markets. In response to the growth in opportunity,
DRC took the decision to build and operate a new state-ofthe-
art facility known as the Greenfield Project.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, DRC has also benefited from the
infrastructure investments that have turned the UAE into
an international hub, as these investments have allowed
the Company to target a number of strategically important
international markets efficiently. Amongst several of its
key milestones is the ones it achieved in 1994, when the
company’s status was amended from a Limited Liability
Company (LLC) to Public Joint Stock Company (PJSC) and in
2007, when DRCs shares were listed on the Dubai Financial
Market (DFM).</p>
<p>The multi-faceted organisation’s longstanding vision is
to be one of the lower Gulf’s leading beverage companies,
driven by top calibre people, equipped with the right tools
and solid systems. Its leadership and management have
developed and defined 10 core values to guide its people:
teamwork, leadership, service excellence, commitment,
effectiveness, respect, winning attitude, integrity, resultsoriented,
and staff wellbeing.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>In 2008, DRC planned to utilised Dubai’s unique position
and developed infrastructure to play a larger regional role,
going beyond Dubai and the Northern Emirates. Recognising
the strong demand from other Pepsi bottlers from the GCC, Africa, and Asia for additional product and the limitations
of manufacturing and product availability on meeting this
demand, DRC invested in its operations to allow the company
to take greater advantage of the opportunity granted by its
strategic position.</p>
<p>Through close cooperation with its international trade
partners, it was able to develop a better understanding of
consumer preferences and more effectively grow its export
business. Its well-planned move proved critical in its success
with PepsiCo and DRC now exports Pepsi products to over
30 countries in Africa and Asia. At present, it continues to
meet the regional Pepsi bottlers’ need for additional supply
and the requirements of African markets with no local Pepsi
bottling operation.</p>
<p>DRC’s focused sales efforts resulted in net revenue
growth from AED 627 Million in 2008 to AED 1,004 Million
in 2012 representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.
Whereas, net operating profit grew from AED 9 Million in
2008 to AED 151 Million in 2012, representing a phenomenal
compound annual growth rate of 102%, making it one of the
most successful ventures from the UAE.</p>

   <b>Refreshing beverages in Afghanistan</b>
        
<p>DRC has maintained a mutually beneficial and highly prosperous relationship with PepsiCo for over 50 years.
Taking its success from the UAE forward, DRC’s location in Dubai allowed it to take advantage of the opportunity
to help develop Afghanistan’s market for PepsiCo products.</p>
<p>The direct impact on the Afghan market was the availability of quality, internationally recognised soft drinks
produced by DRC in Dubai. By improving the availability of the products in Afghanistan, DRC helped to grow the
market for PepsiCo products in the country to the point that a local bottler was then able to begin operations.</p>
<p>Alongside it export business to cover a number of key African markets in North East Africa and Other Africa, its
support for the Afghanistan market has been one of the key success stories for DRC’s operations. Over the years,
DRC has aided the brand in growing the market-share of its products, where the market is now large enough to
support its own bottling operation. Working closely with PepsiCo, it continues to support the local bottling partner
by exporting a wider range of products.</p>

        <p>The United Arab Emirates’ open and highly foresighted
trade policy actively encourages diversification and
growth for every sector. In terms of manufacturing, the
availability of high-quality raw material, tax-free policies
for businesses and convenient trading ports encourage
companies to avail the opportunities on both local and global
scales. These incentives are evidenced in the phenomenal
success of RAK Ceramics, a pioneer in the ceramics industry
headquartered in the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah.</p>
<p>The company’s 1st plant started in Ras Al Khaimah with
a daily output of 5,000 sq. mt. of tiles and annual output of
700,000 sq. mt. of tiles. From this point on, RAK Ceramics’
started out on an unprecedented growth trajectory by
taking bold step to avail the emerging opportunities that
accompanied the rapid expansion of the construction sector
in the UAE and beyond.</p>
<p>The envisioned success path started coming true with
internationalisation of production facilities in the year
2000. Starting with Bangladesh, RAK Ceramics marked
its solid foundations and set out on expanding globally by
establishing facilities in key manufacturing hubs.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/rakcera-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>From its second plant in China in 2003, the company
moved forward to form its third in Sudan, fourth in Iran and
the fifth in India within a span of just 5 years. Furthermore,
it bucked the global economic trends with the capacities of
several facilities doubling even during the downturn.</p>
By 2010, with a total production of 117 million sq. mt. per
annum, RAK Ceramics was recognised as the world’s largest ceramic manufacturer. In the same year, it also listed its
Bangladesh subsidiary on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)
and set a record for the highest-ever IPO collection in the
country.</div>
<p>The organisation’s headquarters span expansive facilities
over an area of 2.5 million sq. mt. including 10 state-of-theart
factories, raw material warehouses, showrooms, offices
buildings as well as research & development laboratories.
It is from here that RAK Ceramics continues on its vision
to maintain its status as the world’s leading innovator in
ceramic field. RAK Ceramics has also bolstered its credibility
with ISO 9001 certification accreditation from CICS UK.</p> 
<p>The company’s responsible and knowledge-driven mission
has enabled it to excel in the field, while growing farther
and wider by adapting to market requirements, redefining
product innovation and maintaining high accountability to
its stakeholders and clients. It is committed to delivering
superior products and services to its customers and
encouraging more stringent safeguarding of the shared
natural resources of the planet.</p>
<p>RAK Ceramics has been a trend-setter in the ceramics
industry and is capable of delivering massive quantities
within a dedicated timeframe. Specialising in high-quality
wall and floor tiles, it offers more than 8,000 designs across
various sizes. In addition, RAK ceramics is the world’s first
company to launch Luminous, a wonder tile which glows
in dark; golden- and silver-glazed tiles; antimicrobial, germ
protective tile; and RAK Slim, an eco-friendly 4.5 mm thick
tile.</p>
<p>Some of the iconic projects in the RAK Ceramics portfolio
in the UAE and the region are Burj Khalifa Downtown – Dubai,
Emirates Palace Hotel - Abu Dhabi, Ferrari Theme Park –Abu
Dhabi, Dubai International Airport, and Princess Noura
University – KSA, among several others. The company’s
current annual global production output stands at 117 million
sq. mt. of tiles, 4.5 million pieces of bathware and 15 million
pieces of tableware, accounting for around USD 1 billion
global sales annually.</p>

<p>Today, RAK Ceramics stands tall as the world’s largest
ceramics manufacturing company, a commendable status
that it has maintained for the last three consecutive years.
Within a short period of just two decades, it has supplied 1
billion sq. mt. of tile across over 160 countries worldwide
from its sixteen manufacturing facilities in six destinations,
employing over 8,000 persons from more than 20 countries.
One of the most phenomenal facts about the company is that
it currently manufactures 250 sq. mt. of tiles every minute,
which is the tiling requirement of one large residential unit
or a villa.</p>
<p>The company’s achievements have also resulted in several
recognitions, the recent among which are the Innovation
Award for its revolutionary RAK Slim tile at Kingfisher
Supplier’s Awards in Hong Kong in 2010, Asia’s Best Brand
and Best Employer Brand at CMO Asia Awards in 2011
organised by US-based CMO Council and Best Innovative
Company at Asian Quality Leadership Awards 2012 in Dubai.
It has also retained the Superbrand status for the last four
consecutive years in the region.</p>

   <b>Paving a success across Europe</b>
        
<p>As a company based in the Arab world, RAK Ceramics took on the challenge to change perceptions in the
stringently quality-driven European markets. In order to be accepted in these strong markets, the company
ensured that it continued to produce nothing short of the best ceramic products at all times.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company’s distribution channel played a vital role in its contribution to major landmarks in various
countries. From its humble beginnings, RAK Ceramics now counts several prestigious projects in European
capitals in its portfolio. Its success can be gauged by the fact that Wembley Stadium – UK, Cologne/Bonn
Airport – Germany and Arena O2 – UK are some of the landmarks executed by RAK Ceramics. It has come to be
recognised as an innovator and a ‘game-changer’ having raised the bar to unmatched levels when it comes to
design, production and promotion through an unparalleled distribution network spread across over 160 countries.</p>
<p>Today, organisations and consumers across the world associate RAK Ceramics with quality, world-class
manufacturing, making it a proud achievement for a UAE-based company.</p>

        <p>The unprecedented growth in the regional real estate,
automotive and industrial sectors during the past two
decades has generated massive demand for high-performing,
eco-friendly and technologically superior varieties of glass.
Further beyond, the global market has always been highly
receptive to technological know-how and experience in
manufacturing of innovative glass products. Keeping an
eye on this scenario, Glass LLC was established as a whollyowned
subsidiary by Dubai Investments PJSC, one of the
UAE’s leading investment conglomerates.</p>
<p>As the first glass holding company in the Middle East, the
group showcases the unique business acumen of the nation
and its creative approach to economic diversification. Glass
LLC incorporates four subsidiaries: Emirates Glass LLC,
established in Al Quoz in 1998 as one of the leaders in energyefficient
and high-performance architectural glass; Emirates
Float Glass (EFG), established in 2005 as a manufacturer
of clear float, body tinted and pyrolytic coated reflective
glass; Lumiglass Industries, established in 2003 to process
safety and security laminated glass for the automotive and
construction industries; and Saudi American Glass Company,
established in 1978 and one of the most well-equipped
suppliers of coated flat glass in KSA.</p>
<p>The company is built on the vision to be the leading
supplier of glass solutions in the region and globally by
bringing together expertise, innovation and high standards
of quality. As a customer-centric entity, it consistently
maintains the highest standards in quality, even while
expanding its product portfolio as well as market reach.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/glass-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	 <p>One of the company’s greatest strengths since its
inception has been its deep knowledge of the market
from 1978 through its well-established subsidiaries. It also
possesses industry-leading expertise in the Middle Eastern
markets when it comes to building standards withstanding
the region’s challenging climate. Furthermore, its portfolio
comprises a dynamic experience in architectural glass
applications worldwide with an extensive list of prestigious
and iconic building projects.</p>
<p>Glass LLC also enjoys the distinction of being the only
intergraded group of companies under Dubai Investments,
which covers an expansive number of industries right from
construction to security to automotive. All of its entities are
also Members of the Glass and Glazing Federation (GGC),
industry authorities on flat glass and glazed products for the
commercial and domestic sectors.</p>
<p>Its credentials are also strengthened by the fact that
it operates the largest and most high-end technological
coating plants in the region. The company also places
emphasis on an environmentally-friendly growth path with
its energy-efficient products recommended by ESTIDAMA
and UAE Building Council. Following Green principles, its
manufacturing processes are based on globally-recognised
standards, audited and certified by LEED.</p>
<p>Glass LLC opened the boundaries for business
development both regionally and internationally by growing
steadily as a leading integrated group of companies. One of
the recent achievements by its entities on the global stage
include the platinum LEED certification award for Kalpataru
Square in India, an Emirates Floating Glass (EFG) furnished building. This further consolidated EGL’s strategy to promote
eco-friendly construction materials and green buildings. The
award conferred by the renowned US Green Building Council
(USGBC) made the Kalpataru Square in India the only
building outside of the USA, and the sixth around the world,
ever to be rated with a Platinum certification according to
the guidelines set forth by LEED Core & Shell Version 2.0.
EFG also received a special award of appreciation from HH
Mohammed Omar Abdullah, Undersecretary, Department
of Economic Development (DED), Abu Dhabi in 2011 for its
contribution towards improving non-oil export from the
emirate of Abu Dhabi in line with Economic Vision 2030.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/glass-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->

<p>Further making a name for the group internationally,
Emirates Glass LLC solidified itself in the market of Turkey
with over 20 million AED worth of orders in the year 2012,
thus venturing into the country as the sole provider of selfcleaning
glass projects with its very own eco-friendly glass
Vitroglaze. In April 2012, the King Abdullah II Design and
Development Bureau (KADDB) Test & Evaluation Centre
acknowledged and awarded Lumiglass Industries LLC with its
certifications for EN1063 European Standards as well as the
official Lumiglass selected products pertaining to standard
EN1522 for glass thicknesses. These certifications go beyond
the numbers and expand the company’s connectivity and
collaboration in an ever-growing target market.</p>
<p>Glass LLC operates from its strategically-based headquarters
in the industrial area of Dubai Investment Park (DIP), located
close to its Coater plant, while its proximity to the Jebel Ali
Port facilitates ease in delivery, thereby charting the continued
growth in the glass industry from the UAE to the world.</p>

   <b>Spreading its global footprint</b>
        
<p>Emirates Float Glass (EFG) has been one of the key
Glass LLC entities showcasing continuous progress
within the global glass industry. EFG supplies
regional and international glass processors with
premium quality float glass products used in the
architectural and automotive industry segments.</p>
<p>In the year 2010, with an emphasis on reaching
far and wide, EFG started shipping to the
emerging market of Brazil. By adopting a flexible
business strategy, improving its logistical process
consistently, and providing the highest level of
customer service, it quickly rose to become the
best-selling imported glass in this market. With
an eye on further growth, EFG upgraded its float
glass manufacturing facility in Abu Dhabi with
a fully-automated production line and achieved
100% capacity utilisation in the year 2012. This
move brought forth results in the same year, as
EFG became the second largest supplier of clear
float glass in Brazil, second only to China and ahead
of the nation’s neighbouring countries of the USA
and Mexico.</p>
<p>Through such strategic advances, the product
markets of this Glass LLC subsidiary have grown
to more than 53 countries spanning South America,
Europe, Australia, Far East Asia, Africa and the GCC.

        <p>Union Cement Company (UCC), the first and the biggest
cement manufacturer in the UAE, was set up in 1972
in the Khor Khwair Industrial Area in Ras Al Khaimah. The
first plant was inaugurated by the late H.H. Sheikh Zayed
Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of the UAE, within a few
months after the formation of the new federation. This
outlined the ambition of the nation to emerge as a diversified,
self-reliant and vibrant global economy. The company
is a regional pioneer in its field being the first cement
manufacturer to have obtained the ISO and API certificates
in the Middle East, while also owning the world’s largest kiln
when installed.</p>
<p>One of the most important local industries in Ras Al
Khaimah is the cement and building materials industry, which
benefits from the Emirate’s abundant natural resources,
comprised of mountainous terrains holding rich mineral
deposits. Having recognised the importance of this to a fastdeveloping
region, the company commenced production
with the first line in 1975 under the management of ‘Norcem
AS’, a member of HeidelbergCement Group. Its second line
started in the year 1977 followed by the third one in 1979.
The favourable business environment in the UAE enabled
UCC to deliver its products across the nation. Moreover, the
development of an excellent infrastructure helped reduce
transport times, thereby increasing its turnover.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Continuing its aim to provide the highest-standard
products and best customer service, UCC obtained the ISO
9000 certification in 1994. What’s more, in the years 1980 and 2000, UCC added the American Petroleum Institute
(API) Spec Q1 and the ISO 14001 certifications respectively,
signalling its dedication to the environment.</p>
<p>In addition to the domestic market, with its proximity to
the Saqr Port, UCC capitalised on the opportunity to serve the
Middle East and East African markets. This provided it with
a strategic advantage to import raw materials, machinery,
spare parts and equipment. Based in the only Emirate in the
UAE that produces oil well cement, white cement and lime,
Union Cement Company (UCC) has emerged to be a major
domestic supplier and exporter of cement and clinker.</p>
<p>When the company started out, its first and second
production lines had production capacity of 750 tonnes per
day each. Over the next two decades, this grew rapidly to
meet local and regional demand. In 2006, UCC commissioned
its milestone fourth plant, a 10,000 tonnes per day clinker
production kiln that increased its capacity from 1.2 to 4.25
million tonnes per annum. In the next year, cement mills 5
and 6 increased the company’s grinding capacity to 4.27
million tonnes per annum, making it the biggest cement
manufacturer in the UAE. </p> 
<p>In addition to maintaining consistently high production
quality, the company offers a wide product range which
includes ordinary Portland cement, high, moderate and low
sulphate resisting cement and well cement. Moreover, UCC’s
bulk tanker fleet offers the right competitive edge to deliver cement to its customers wherever needed. Showcasing
formidable growth, UCC has taken its yearly sales from
275,000 tonnes in 1977 to over 3.0 million tonnes in 2008.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->


<p> To date, its cement products have been used in several
prestigious projects like the Dubai Golf Club, Burj Al
Arab, and Abu Dhabi Mall, to name a few. As a sociallyresponsible
organisation, UCC is also involved in a slew of
social development activities and has commenced many
environmental sustainability programmes. It also plays a
positive role in the progress of the community though its
Emaratisation initiatives and support for the national cadre.
It was recognised for these efforts by the GCC Ministers of the
Labor and Social Affairs in the year 2009 at the ceremonial
function of the 26th conference.</p>

   <b>Cementing its lead in the regional export market and beyond</b>
        
<p>In the 1980s UCC expanded its focus to the export of cement in order to take its domestic success beyond the
Emirates. The Free Trade policy of the UAE, coupled with eased logistics due to its strategic location and its strong
capabilities enabled UCC to supply its products in a timely manner to international markets.</p>
<p>However, international competition and increasing port charges made it a challenging scenario for UCC. Yet,
through maintaining high quality and monitoring international standards regularly, the company was able to make
quick inroads into the GCC markets. Furthermore, the advantage of being able to export products without import
taxes or duties helped UCC deliver greater value to its regional customers.</p>
<p>Starting out by exporting via road to Qatar, the company quickly expanded its market to the rest of the GCC,
Middle East and East Africa through marine routes. Presently, UCC has plans to extend its export base to West
Africa and South America. As the construction markets globally continue to seek better offerings in raw materials,
UCC is strategically placed to emerge as a key competitor amongst the many names in the field.</p>

        <p>Since its inception in 2000, Arabian Can Industry (ACI)
paved the way for a new export-oriented approach in
the local can industry. With a clear vision to provide the GCC,
Middle East and Subcontinent markets with high-quality OTS
cans and products, ACI operates with a dedicated Research
and Development team that compliments its Production
team.</p>
<p>The company, which is part of the Al Ghurair Group,
specialises in 3-piece metal can manufacturing suitable for
packing all types of foodstuff, and complements the group’s
packaging trio, which includes Taghleef Industries (Film
Packaging) and Arabian Packaging (Paper Packaging). The
product line ranges in size from 79 grams to 5 kilograms.
ACI also supplies printed tin sheets with their components.
Further expansion projects are also underway to add new
sizes of cans to the company’s product portfolio.</p>


<div id="co_img">

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
<p>Situated in the industrial area of Jebel Ali, Dubai, Arabian
Can Industry is well-known for its established records
of quality, reliability and stability. The company has an
integrated and versatile can plant with full in-house facilities
for tinplate printing, coating and fabrication of built-up cans
and component making. By using modern machineries in
Printing and Design Technology, manned by highly trained
and qualified employees, the factory has got the capacity
and facilities to produce any item related to food or general
cans, ends and components as well as printed sheets.</p>
	
<p>Process wise, the company applies the latest in production
operations and quality control. Since the products are mainly
used for food packaging, it is an integral part of ACI’s policy to conduct research and work in close collaboration with
clients, to develop products that are of the highest quality
possible. The production process itself, applies high-speed
technologies and high-quality printing techniques to
embed quality in the entire product lifecycle. In addition,
the production chain is monitored and checked by the welltrained
Quality Control team, which conducts tests through
all the production phases from raw material selection till final
output and delivery.</p>
<p>To complement their overall quality offering, ACI
is committed to environmental purity throughout the
production process. Therefore, the company applies its
own air toxic emission control programme, which includes
annual analyses of chemicals through reputed Laboratories to make sure that all discharges to the air environment are
in accordance with the requirements of the EPSS Technical
guidelines of the Dubai Municipality. Similar procedures are
applied to general waste, liquid and solid hazardous waste
and ventilation.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/aracan-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
<p>With such a high-quality lifecycle of ACI products, the
company has formed a clear pathway to international
markets around the world. It became available to export
markets from 2003, when the company started production.
The company currently has business ties with clients in the
Middle East and the Subcontinent, encouraged by both
the reputed quality of ACI’s products and its cost-effective
transportation scheme which is favourable to the majority
of clients. </p>

   <b>Hassle-free logistics</b>
        
<p>As a committed manufacturer, ACI
has developed its own transportation
scheme, which became popular among
its clients in the Middle East and South
West Asia. Due to the proximity of
these two regions to the UAE, ACI
made arrangements with Logistics and
Transportation companies operating
from the UAE to these regions so that
they provide ACI shipments to its
clients with favourable services, hasslefree
operation and cost- effective rates.
With a ‘right to the doorstep of your

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>Taghleef Industries was formed in 2006 when Al
Ghurair Group’s Dubai Poly Film (established in 1998)
acquired Technopack, in Egypt, and AKPP, in Oman, to form
Taghleef Industries, with an initial annual output capacity
of 100,000 tonnes. Soon after that, the newly formulated
company moved to consolidate its positions in the global
arena and to enhance its manufacturing power by acquiring
plants in Australia, Italy and Hungary. The company also
has two logistics centres in Germany and the USA as well as
a Research and Development Centre in Italy.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/taghleef-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Taghleef Industries is today one of the top three leading
companies in its industry worldwide.The company develops,
manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of highquality
transparent, white voided and metalised BoPP (bioriented
polypropylene) and CPP (cast propylene) films for
snacks, confectionery, frozen and normal food packaging,
fresh produce as well as labelling and adhesive tapes. Other
applications include lamination with glossy and matte films
of other products like paper. With current annual output
capacity of over 260,000 tonnes of BoPP of which 60,000
tonnes/year are of metalised film, the company enjoys a
customer base in over a hundred countries around the globe.</p>
	
	<p>Taghleef Industries’ acquisitions in Europe came with
significant advantages to both the group and its customer base. Corporate wise, Taghleef benefited in improving
its manufacturing optimisation and in the synergetic use
of resources and procurement. Business wise, the new
acquisition opened up new important sectors to the group
including: high-barrier transparent and metalised film and
labelling film, all sectors in which the former Radici Film
gained a primary role over the years. Above all, Taghleef has
now joined to its elite group of experts some of Europe’s
finest minds behind the Film and BoPP industry in both
R&D and Production.</p> 


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/taghleef-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>And because it is a UAE company, where people come
first, Taghleef Industries is also a worldwide leader
in environmentally-friendly film manufacturing. The company has adopted the concept of bio-plastic (BoPla)
film manufacturing, which uses a natural extract called
PLA (Poly Lactic Acid) polymer as a base material for the
film. All other raw materials involved in the manufacturing
process are also from renewable resources. The new
product line, branded Ingeo, is completely biodegradable
and compostable; offering a wider range of end-of-life
options, including recycling and industrial composting.
To further compliment its environmental commitments,
Taghleef Industries has come up with a new initiative in
order to be able to quantify, monitor, compare and control
the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted from their site
and their products.</p>

   <b>Making strides in research and development</b>
        
<p>When Taghleef Industries bought Radici Film in
summer 2008, the advantages were not only to the
two large manufacturing plants in Italy and Hungary.
The deal went beyond that to provide Taghleef with
an essential component for its future ambitious
plans of becoming a multi-national player in its field
of industry; Research and Development.</p>
<p>With an advanced Research and Development
centre, such as the one Radici Film had, Taghleef
became capable of providing its global customers
with quality and cutting-edge products in terms of
technology and applications with efficient service.</p>
<p>The company’s key abilities are symbolised by its
extensive knowledge and understanding of BOPP
film, its properties and characteristics, enabling the
generation of new ideas on product development.</p>
<p>Currently, Taghleef’s Research and Development
team is composed of scientists and specialists
with transversal skills, from food to industrial
chemistry. Primary activities at the main R-and-D
extended laboratory include the development of
new advanced solutions for the packaging industry;
working on product enhancement and innovative
projects; film analysis and quality tests; as well as
working in close collaboration with raw materials
suppliers, converters, producers of printing and
labelling machines, various university research
centres, public and private research institutes.</p>

        <p>Gulf Craft, the Middle East’s and Asia’s leading
fiberglass yacht and boat manufacturer, Driven by
an entrepreneurial spirit, Mohammed Hussein Al-Shaali,
a young businessman from the UAE, together with his 2
brothers, decided to follow their passion of the sea with
the idea of constructing 15 to 18-ft fishing boats for local
use. In 1982, the ambitious entrepreneurship consequently
established Gulf Craft.</p>
<P>The 1990s witnessed major successes when Gulf Craft
became a yacht manufacturer, not only broadening its
products’ base but also its types of clients. The first yacht
that was built by the company was the Adora 53 in 1992. In
1999, the company grew to a higher niche by launching the
super yacht, Millennium 118.</P>
<p>In the early 2000s, Gulf Craft began looking at the world
as its market place and that changed the culture of the
company. It launched Majesty Yachts brand of luxury yachts
in 2003 to increasingly serve the European market.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Over the last three decades, the company has succeeded
to grow to become one of the most internationally renowned
names in the building of various types of multi-decked motoryachts.
Gulf Craft’s yachts and boats today are exported to
over 40 countries around the globe. The superb delivery track
record the company has shown over these years driven by
the foresighted visionary management along with the UAE’s
supportive foreign trade policy and central location are the
main drivers that took the company’s wings to fly towards
the international competitive market.</p>
<p>In addition, Technology has always been a decisive factor
in the world of manufacturing. And for Gulf Craft, the use
of technologies such as sandwich construction and vacuum infusion processes, water-jet drives engineered on large
yachts, and gyro marine stabilizers, was an essential step in
meeting the highest of market expectations.</p>
<p>The Majesty Yachts, a new brand introduced by Gulf
Craft in 2003, has boosted the company’s position on an
international stage. The company, through this brand, has
not only succeeded to enter the European market but also
has propelled into the international spotlight and began to
be considered as a global player with a respected product
range. Gulf Craft’s superyachts are continuing to head to
European waters with flag ships like the Majesty 135 and the
Majesty 125.</p> 

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/gulfcraft-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    <p>The company has shown a continuous strong performance,
succeeding to increase its exports to reach 70% of its
production. This has indeed made it one of the distinguished
UAE Highflyers in its second edition.</p>
<p>Today, Gulf Craft employs 1,500 staff in its facilities
located in 3 emirates of the UAE as well as a shipyard in the
Maldives. With a product line ranging from 26 foot runabouts
and sport fishing boats, to 135 feet luxury motor yachts, the
company has an annual production capacity of more than
500 boats through its three brands Majesty Yachts, Oryx and
Silvercraft.</p>

   <b>Turning challenges into successes</b>
        
<p>One of the biggest challenges Gulf Craft has faced was not
just building a unique business but also an industry in a region
that was not really recognized as yachts manufacturing centre.
Thus, the international market was not used to seeing a ‘Made
in the UAE’ tag for an ultimate luxury product such as a yacht.</p>
<p>However, over the past 30 years, Gulf Craft has managed to
turn these challenges into success stories by maintaining a
100% delivery track – which meant that every build that has
been ordered has been delivered on time. The successful
track record, the quality of its product and its financial solidity
over these years have helped build a very firm reputation of
reliability and trust which is highly prized in this business.</p>
<p>Moreover the company has focused on a more personalized
approach in designing each build. All of its manufacturing,
crafting and finishing processes are carried out in-house. Gulf
Craft has built a reputation for offering a higher quality of
product – that is actively competing within its competitor set
on a global stage – at greater value.</p>

        <p>When people started converting their furniture that
were made from animal wool and palm trees wood
to more manufactured and developed furniture items in
1970s, Abbas Ali Al-Hazeem, a young UAE entrepreneur,
took the initiative of establishing and operating a company
that would make its way in the furniture realm. In
1974, “International Foam and Furnishing Company” was
established to produce polyurethane foam and sell furniture
in Al Rashiyah area, Dubai. Within a short span of time, the
company was recognized with a wide range of foam, one
of the basic building blocks of the furniture industry. By
mastering this essential product and through development
and integration, the national Dubai-based enterprise turned
into a multinational company that is not only specialized in
foam production but also in the manufacturing of different
sleep systems along with bedding accessories like pillows,
comforters and sofa sets.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/interco-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
<p>The foresighted industrial vision and strong business values
embedded by the company’s cofounder established the
fundamentals on the company’s structure to be international
in an early stage. Today, Intercoil has 7 showrooms in the UAE,
2 showrooms in Oman, 2 showrooms in Kuwait, 3 showrooms
in Saudi Arabia and one showroom in Qatar, Lebanon, Egypt,
Iran and India. In addition, Intercoil’s products are present in
17 countries across two continents.</p>
	
<p>Committed to its expansion roadmap, Intercoil is in
the way of boosting its geographical reach by setting-up
subsidiaries and distribution points to new territories such
as CIS countries, South-East-West Africa, Central Asia
and Eastern Europe. Thus joint venture, partnerships and commercial agencies are to be formed with the UAE-based
sleep system supplier. These fast developing economic
regions will contribute significantly to the overall growth of
Intercoil.</p> 

<p>The company’s success is not only presented through the
regional distribution of its highly-competitive products but
also by the creation of several world-class manufacturing
organizations in several countries in the Middle East region.
Simmons Middle East was established as the licensee of
Simmons for the whole of GCC, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and
Iraq.</p>

<p>Arriving at the top is a relatively-straightforward journey
but maintaining that position is the real challenge. This
principle is implanted in the company’s strategy. Thus,
upgrading and improving its product offering has been
constantly driven by continuous innovation and improvement
of Intercoil. This has assured/will continue to assure the
strong and sustainable growth over the past and upcoming
years. Towards its objective of becoming a global leading
manufacturer, Intercoil recorded several milestones as
proofs of the progress, such as being the first in the industry
to achieve the ISO 9001:2000, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001
quality management certificates. In addition, the company
received the Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR] Label
Award by Dubai Chamber, the Dubai Quality Appreciation
Certificate and was ranked number 4 among Dubai SME 100.</p>

   <b>Supplying prestigious projects</b>
        
<p>In 2011, Intercoil achieved a 25% growth in
sales. It gained a significant market share
across various sectors like hospitality. It also
supplied its world-class products to several
prestigious projects, including The Westin,
Abu Dhabi, The Kempinski Al Rashid, Baghdad,
St. Regis - Saadiyat Island Abu Dhabi, The
Millennium Plaza - Dubai, St. Regis - Qatar and
The Rotana Hotels - Abu Dhabi. As a result
of these achievements, the company has
decided to expand its physical appearance in
the MENA region. In 2012, Intercoil launched
showrooms in Jordan and Lebanon, marking
the expanding takeoff of the company. To
cater the increasing demand, it added two
manufacturing facilities in Sharjah. As a result,
the production capacity has jumped to 700-
800 mattresses per day. Intercoil is currently
targeting the MENA region and planning to
open eight showrooms across the region.</p>
