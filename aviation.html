        “The incredible success of Emirates and Dubai are intricately linked. Dubai is a dynamic and vibrant city, and it has played a key role in shaping Emirates into the carrier that it is today. Dubai is centrally located between East and West, with access to two-thirds of the world’s population via a maximum eight-hour flight. This geographical positioning has served to provide us with a unique advantage and one that we have certainly capitalized on.
<p> At Emirates, we believe that competition is good for the industry, and importantly, it is even better for the customer. Our success is governed by our long-term strategy of reinvesting our profits directly into our product. In the last financial year alone, we invested heavily in new products that will help us maintain our position as one of the world’s fastest-growing and most innovative airlines.”</p>

        <p>Civil aviation connects cities and countries, people
        and places, and is central to the growth of nation’s
        economies and the world at large. Dubai as a tourism, trade
        and lifestyle hub hosts over 200 nationalities that thrive in
        this multicultural metropolis, and Emirates is at the very
        heart of it, as an airline that is truly international in stature. It is a unique company and an ambitious success story, in that
        it draws its strength from the open skies environment at its
        main operating base, Dubai International Airport, where it
        competes with over 120 other scheduled airlines.</p>
        <p>Emirates, in a span of under two decades, has turned into
        one of the world’s fastest growing airlines, mirroring the
        growth of the nation from where it took wings. Starting with
        just two aircraft in its formative days in 1985, the airline now
        boasts a fleet of nearly 200 fuel-efficient aircraft. Throughout
        the company’s history, upgrading and expanding the fleet
        has been a continuous programme and its business strategy
        has charted the growth of its global network of routes which
        today spans six continents.</p>
        <p>Today, Emirates flies to over 125 destinations in 74
        countries and no fewer than 15 new destinations were added
        during the year 2012 alone. Starting with Rio de Janeiro
        and Buenos Aires on 3rd January 2012 and including Dublin,
        Dallas Fort Worth, Seattle, Lusaka, Harare, Ho Chi Minh
        City, Barcelona, Lisbon, Erbil, Washington DC and Adelaide,
        finally concluding the year by commencing services to Lyon
        and Phuket in December 2012. Furthermore, in line with this
        increase in destinations and to facilitate aircraft upgrades of many routes, coupled with additional frequencies around
        the network, Emirates received delivery of 33 aircraft during
        2012, a record for the airline.</p>

        <p>The secret to the airline’s business success is to provide
        the best service in the industry through inter-linked,
        complementary array of businesses. These include Emirates
        SkyCargo, an award-winning international cargo division; a
        full-fledged destination management and leisure division including Emirates Holidays, Arabian Adventures and
        Wolgan Valley Resort & Spa, among others; EmQuest - an
        airline IT developer and Emirates Engineering – an advanced
        aircraft maintenance provider.</p>
	
        <p>The airline’s growth has been consistent over the years
        and it has been making waves at every step of the way. In
        2001, Emirates demonstrated its confidence in the industry’s
        future growth by announcing the largest order in aviation history, valued at USD 15 billion. While in 2005,
        it announced the largest-ever order for the
        Boeing 777 family of aircraft – 42 in all – worth
        USD 9.7 billion. At the 2006 Farnborough Air
        Show, Emirates signed a Heads of Agreement
        for 10 of Boeing’s new 747-8F aircraft, to be
        powered by General Electric’s GEnx jet engines.</p> 
        <p>Emirates still regards the Airbus A380 as its
        flagship aircraft and the ultimate symbol of its
        pioneering spirit, continuing to expand the fleet
        and the routes it serves. Already flying this fleet
        of over 30 iconic double-deckers to Amsterdam,
        Auckland, Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Jeddah,
        Johannesburg, Kuala Lumpur, London Heathrow,
        Manchester, Melbourne, Munich, New York JFK,
        Paris, Rome, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and
        Toronto, the airline has plans in the pipeline to increase the
        destinations even further as new aircraft currently on order
        are received.</p>

        <p>Testimonial to its stature as an innovative leader, it is also
        the world’s largest operator of the Boeing 777 and celebrated
        the unveiling of the 1,000th Boeing 777 in March 2012 at the
        manufacturer’s plant in Everett, Washington State. This
        landmark aircraft became the 102nd to join the airline’s 777
        fleet.</p>
        Emirates SkyCargo, the freight division of Emirates,
        continues to be a significant force in the global air cargo
        industry, expanding its fleet or freighters by taking delivery 		of four additional Boeing 777 freighters during 2012. During the         2011/12 financial year, Emirates SkyCargo carried almost 1.8
        million tons of cargo, demonstrating its resilience and ability
        to grow revenues against the industry norm. Contributing
        16.2 per cent of Emirates’ total transport revenue, Emirates
        SkyCargo continues to play an integral role in the company’s
        expanding operations.</p>
        <p>SkyCargo also continues to win awards, again scooping
        several prestigious accolades during 2012, including Cargo
        Airline of the year, Best African Cargo Airline and, for the
        24th consecutive year, Best Middle East Cargo Airline at the
        Cargo Airline of the Year Awards, as well as being named
        Air Cargo Carrier of the Year for the sixth time at the Global
        Freight Awards.</p>
        <p>In May 2012, the Emirates Group, which includes dnata
        one of the world’s largest air services providers, posted
        profits of US$ 629 million for the financial year ending 31st
        March 2012. It was the 24th consecutive year of profits
        amidst unprecedented economic pressure and record
        high fuel prices. Further to this landmark achievement,
        Emirates’ position as the industry-leading A380 operator was
        reinforced with the opening of the world’s first purpose-built
        A380 concourse on 1 January 2013 at the Dubai International
        Airport.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Part of the strategic plan by Dubai Airports to support
Emirates’ ambitious growth, the new concourse is also
tipped to bolster Dubai’s ambition to become the largest
international air hub in the world by 2018. Moreover, it will
become the nerve centre of Emirates’ A380 operations and
as the company’s growing fleet of popular double-deckers
touches more points around the globe, it brings new levels of
environmental sensitivity. In addition, its enhanced facilities
and features will provide a new level in the passenger
experience of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Continuing its financial success, in March 2013, Emirates
issued a one billion dollar Sukuk on NASDAQ Dubai, the
Middle East’s international financial exchange. Reinforcing
the strength of its business, the Sukuk was sold successfully
to investors from around the world.</p>
<p>As the fleet and destinations grow, Emirates’ recruitment
drive also shifts up a gear, with road shows and recruitment
events worldwide as the airline strives to maintain the cosmopolitan nature of its multinational, multilingual crew.
During 2012, the number of pilots working for the airline grew
to over 3,000 with a current figure of some 16,000 cabin crew
from over 130 nationalities. In total, over 67,000 staff are
employed across the entire Emirates Group. In the financial
year 2011/2012, Emirates carried 34 million passengers and
1.8 million tonnes of cargo.</p>

   <b>Smarter technology to enhance the customer experience</b>
        
    <p>Creating the ultimate passenger experience remains of
    paramount importance to Emirates. No wonder then that the
    brand constantly leads the way with technological innovation,
    from the inflight entertainment to provision of on-board
    connectivity, which have proven to be one of keys to its
    continued success.</p>
    <p>Its multi award-winning “ice” digital widescreen provides
    passengers with over 1,400 channels from which to choose. All
    new Boeing 777 aircraft joining the fleet come equipped with
    some of the industry’s widest personal HD TV screens going
    up to 27-inch in First Class. The screens are also enhanced by
    Emirates’ new touch-based Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>
    <p>For business travellers and those who need to stay connected
    whilst in the air, the latest technology offered by the OnAir
    system allows passengers on board any A380 to use their
    own mobile phones to make and receive phone calls and text
    messages inflight, in addition to using the OnAir WiFi service.
    The first recorded A380 inflight call was placed to China while
    the aircraft cruised at 11,500 metres flying from to Dubai to
    Munich.</p>
    <p>During 2012, the airline also drove the further development
    of a line-of-business application named Knowledge Driven
    Inflight Service (KIS), operating on Windows 8 HP ElitePad
    business tablets, enabling Emirates cabin crew to continue to
    deliver extraordinary customer service to passengers.</p>

   <b>Flying high, the environmentally-friendly way</b>
        
    <p>Operating a young fleet with an average aircraft age of less
    than 80 months makes a significant contribution to Emirates’
    ability to maintain its leading position in the industry in
    terms of fuel efficiency. Among the many phenomenal
    achievement of the company is the fact that even as
    Emirates has grown leaps and bounds, its fuel-efficiency
    rating is some 22% lower than the IATA (International Air
    Transport Association) global fleet average.</p>
    
    <p>Emirates participates in the INSPIRE (Indian Ocean
    Strategic Partnership to Reduce Emissions) Programme, a
    partnership created in March 2011 between air navigation
    service providers and a select group of airlines with the aim
    of using best practices to reduce the fuel burn and carbon
    emissions associated with aviation.</p>
     
     <p>Evidencing its commitment, Emirates conducted three
    test flights – Dubai to Brisbane, Perth to Dubai and Dubai
    to Durban. Using a Boeing 777-300ER, the airline’s most
    fuel-efficient aircraft, the flights involved a number of
    operational and navigational efficiency improvements
    that included minimising on ground delays and utilising
    expedient taxi-and runways, among several others. The first
    two test flights produced a combined total saving of over
    five tonnes of fuel and 16 tonnes of CO2. The third flight to
    Durban resulted in savings of nearly two tonnes of fuel and
    six tonnes of CO2 emissions.</p>

        <p>Amid the real estate renaissance and due to the
        unprecedented growth of UAE residents and visitors
        in the end of the nineties, a hospitality company “Jumeirah
        Group” was established to meet the increasing demand for
        hotels and resorts not only in the UAE but also in the region.
        With hard work and commitment, Jumeirah Group has
        successfully built a world-class portfolio of prestigious hotels
        and resorts within a short span of operation.</p>
        <p>Jumeirah Group’s journey of success commenced with
        opening Jumeirah Beach Hotel in Dubai in 1997. In the
        following years, a number of landmark properties in the
        UAE were launched under the group’s management : Wild
        Wadi Water Park and Jumeirah’s flagship hotel “Burj Al Arab”
        in 1999, Jumeirah Emirates Towers in 2000, the Emirates
        Academy of Hospitality Management in 2001 and Madinat
        Jumeirah in 2003.</p>
        <p>Building on its rich expertise in launching and managing luxurious hotels and resorts, Jumeirah Group successfully
        established its own Arabian traditions of luxury in hospitality
        that enabled it to fly high on the international sphere.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
    <p>In 2001, the international expansion plans started out in
    London with the launching of Jumeirah Carlton Tower and
    Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel. The selection of these hotels came
    after a careful evaluation process that resulted in acquiring
    them. For instance, Jumeirah Carlton Tower was chosen based on its strategic location as it is situated in the heart
    of fashionable Knightsbridge and is within walking distance
    of the prestigious Harrods and Harvey Nichols department
    stores, and luxury designer boutiques lining Sloane Street.
    The hotel was voted ‘4th Best UK Business Hotel’ at the
    Conde Nast Traveller Reader’s Travel Awards 2010 and in the
    top three Best Hotels for Service in the UK in the Conde Nast
    Gold List 2011.</p>

    <img src="images/jumeirah-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Effectively and uniquely managing the properties is
    the first priority of the group which was commercially
    important for the validity and credibility of the brand. “STAY
    DIFFERENT” trade mark – a commitment by Jumeirah Group
    to ensure that every guest is an individual and is different –
    was launched to reconfirm that the individuality of each
    guest as well as each hotel and resort. And so far, it has been
    achieving these goals in Dubai and London developments.
    As it takes on new hotels, the company is committed to
   demonstrate to its owners that they made the right choice. The group is currently looking at expanding within the
        region and within Asia. Its ambitious expansion plans to
        grow its portfolio of luxury hotels and resorts worldwide are
        well underway, with projects currently under development
        in the UAE, Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt, Morocco, India,
        Indonesia, Thailand, China, Azerbaijan and the Caribbean.</p>
        
        <p>Joining Dubai Holding, a global investment holding
    company headquartered in Dubai, in 2004 has given the
    group support to continue its international expansion
    strategy. By 2005, Jumeirah has established itself as a leader in hospitality business operating highly successful hotels in
    Dubai and London. At that point the company decided to
    embark on the path of international expansion on a hotel
    management basis (common industry practice followed by other leading hotel companies), and signed its first letter of
    understanding for a hotel in Shanghai. This was followed by
    launching Jumeirah Essex House in New York. </p>

    <p>The company has also expanded to include luxury serviced
    apartments and residences under the brand ‘Jumeirah
    Living’ with launching Jumeirah Living World Trade Centre
    Residence in 2008. Recently, successive expansions have
    been witnessed locally and internationally.</p>
    <p>Even though it is much newer than renowned brands
    that have been around for decades, Jumeirah Group has
    successfully developed its awareness on a global basis.
    However, when it comes to the luxury end, Jumeirah is
    certainly up there in recognition with companies like Four
    Seasons, Shangri-La and the Ritz-Carlton. It is recognized
    in that market space by the travelers who use hotels at that
    level.</p>

        <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has risen within a short
    span of time to build a highly commendable civil and
    commercial aviation history. One of the most innovative
    and iconic names in this sector is Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA).
    The company, formed in 1976 by a Royal Decree, initially
    started off with a capital of AED 2 million. By the year 2011,
    it successfully transformed itself into a major group with a
    commendable international presence and an annual turnover
    in excess of AED 1.8 billion.</p>
    <p>Starting with just two aircraft, the company gradually
    grew to expand its operations and even form two subsidiaries.
    As part of His Highness the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al
    Nahyan’s policy of encouraging national companies, the
    company was transferred to full public status on 16 May
    1982. This resulted in the establishment of a National Joint
    Stock Company with a capital of AED 60 million with the
    government retaining 30% of the capital. By 1983, its fleet
    size increased to a total of 34 aircraft, flying over 38,800
    hours annually, an average of over 100 hours per day.</p>
    
    <p>In the year 1985, ADA received the authorisation to
    operate fixed wing aircraft and to conduct third-party aircraft
    maintenance, while it was awarded its first fixed wing aircraft
    contract in 1991. Following this, the group continually
    expanded its operations across the region and beyond.
    Presently it has, to its credit, numerous completed contracts
    throughout the Middle East as well as a several global ones
    including a prestigious fire-fighting contract in Spain. ADA
    also provides two critical, round-the-clock health and rescue
    services: medical evacuation service (medevac) for all the oil companies based in Abu Dhabi as well as search and rescue
    support for the UAE Armed Forces.</p>

    <img src="images/adaviation-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
    <p>In order to expandits service scope, the group formed Royal
    Jet, an international luxury flight services provider, in the year
    2003 as a joint venture with the Presidential Flight Authority
    (PFA). Royal Jet is a pioneer of luxury executive flight services
    in the Middle East and has achieved phenomenal growth
    with a significant international presence. It has won several
    commendations including ‘World’s Leading Private Jet Service’ at the World Travel Awards for five consecutive years.
    Its current fleet of aircraft includes six Boeing Business Jets,
    making it the world’s single largest independent operator of
    this jetliner.</p> 
    <p>Its second subsidiary, Maximus Air Cargo, is the largest
    all-cargo airline operator in the UAE. It was established in
    2005 and has rapidly become a key player in the region and
    was voted ‘Air Cargo Operator of the Year’ at leading regional
    industry awards. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Maximus also has a European office in Stansted in the UK
    and operates a fully-owned fleet of eight
    freighter aircraft. It excels in a number of
    key market sectors including operating
    scheduled cargo services on behalf of
    renowned airlines like Etihad, Iberia and Air
    France. The airline is also a market leader
    in managing oversized, heavy and highrisk
    loads.</p>
    <p>Reflecting Abu Dhabi Aviation’s
    commitment to humanitarian causes,
    Maximum continues to be the exclusive
    air relief support partner for the UAE Red
    Crescent. In addition, the airline is also a
    founder member of Care by Air, a relief
    initiative.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>ADA also provided six helicopters to
    serve as air ambulances in the Kingdom
    of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This was the result
    of the excellent market reputation as
    well as the trust and confidence that the
    company instils. This agreement proved that the Middle
    Eastern aviation sector is capable of delivering world-class
    air ambulances for emergency medical service purposes
    across the region.</p>
    
	<p>ADA has also operated one Bell 212 helicopter in support of
    long-term contracts for a major oil company in the Republic
    of Yemen. Additionally, the company has an on-going
    fire-fighting contract in Spain. The company’s marketing
    department actively pursues new business opportunities
    worldwide.</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA) has been an innovative and
    forward-moving group. One of its advancements is utilising
    specialist under slung load techniques for seismic surveys for
    oil and other natural resources. Since its inception, ADA has
    flown over 770,000 hours in helicopters and over 35,000 hours
    in fixed wing aircraft. Recognising its achievements, Bell
    Helicopter awarded the company with a plaque representing 700,000 helicopter hours.</p>
    <p>Since its inception, ADA is now approaching the highlylaudable
    milestones of 1,000,000 flight hours in helicopters
    and over 55,000 hours in fixed wing aircraft. Sustaining these
    successes requires a high degree of dedication, commitment
    and professionalism, which is why ADA has made these the
    hallmarks of its team of pilots, engineers and support staff.
    In the recent past, ADAmoved to a larger purpose-built
    facility at the Abu Dhabi International Airport in order to
    substantially expand its capabilities, while exploring greater
    challenges globally. For the year ending 2011, the group’s
    operating profit reached US$ 127 million, up 13%, while net
    profit increased by 22% to US$ 76.46 million.</p>

    <p>The motto at Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA) continues to be
    ‘The sky is the limit’, as it believes that there is always room for
    expansion in the multifarious aviation sectors. An example is
    the area of training that has a new simulation centre under construction, which will serve not only its employees, but

   <b>Flying high in Spain</b>
        
    <p>Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA) has a commendable
    track-record of undertaking high-risk aerial
    support not just in the UAE, but also beyond
    national borders. Its helicopters are configured
    to perform a number of specialised tasks. One
    of its longest-running contracts in this field is
    with the Catalonia region of Spain. The company
    has been undertaking fire-fighting services, as
    and when required, in the region since the year
    1996. Spain’s dry climate and wooded terrain
    make it highly vulnerable to wildfire outbursts,
    especially during the hot summer months. This
    was demonstrably severe in the year 2009 when
    ADA successfully managed to contain several
    wildfires.</p>
    <p>ADA uses Bell 212 and 412s helicopters fitted
    with highly-effective Isolair ventral tank and
    snorkel systems for these critical tasks. These are
    regularly seen in action in Catalonia, scooping up
    and delivering water to quench the flames.</p>

   <b>Enabling aerial care across Saudi Arabia</b>
        
        <p>In the year 2010, Abu Dhabi Aviation (ADA) signed an agreement with the Saudi Red Crescent Authority to
    provide six helicopters to serve as air ambulances.This agreement further strengthened commercial relations
    between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the UAE, while achieving significant growth for ADA in this
    key market. It also showcased the trust and confidence in ADA’s capability to provide international standards in
    services needed to meet the requirements of Saudi Arabia’s Emergency Medical Services Programme.</p>
    <p>As part of the contract, ADA provided six fully-crewed helicopters, comprising four Bell 412s and two AW 139s
    as air ambulances, to be stationed at the two main bases of Saudi Arabia - Jeddah and Riyadh, providing roundthe-
    clock coverage.</p>
    <p>This agreement represented an important milestone in the company’s global expansion strategy. Most importantly,
    this HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Services) operation in KSA contributed greatly towards saving many
    lives through timely support, in particular during the Ramadan and Hajj seasons.</p>

        <p>Aviation is the backbone of any destination that aims
        to be a strategic hub for business, trade, tourism
        and commerce. More so in the case of the UAE, which has
        the vision to be the centre of the world as a link between
        economies globally. Etihad Airways, the national airline of
        the United Arab Emirates, plays a commendable role in this
        aspect, while building strategic international partnerships.
        Set up by Royal Decree in July 2003, Etihad Airways
        commenced commercial operations in November 2003 and
        has gone on to become one of the fastest growing airlines in
        the history of commercial aviation. It has, in a short span of
        just under a decade, established itself as the world’s leading
        airline.</p>
        <p>Soaring ahead with its foresighted plans, the airline
        unfailingly reflects the best of Arabian hospitality - cultured,
        considerate, warm and generous and continues to enhance
        the prestige of Abu Dhabi as a centre of hospitality between
        East and West.</p>
       <p> By June 2006, the airline grew to 30 destinations in
        30 months. In 2008 Etihad carried more than 6 million
        passengers, a 30 percent increase from 2007, and flew to over
        50 destinations. Continuing this trends, by 2009 the airline
        had achieved a target of over 60 destinations including
        Melbourne, Astana, Istanbul, Athens, Larnaca, Chicago,
        Cape Town and Hyderabad.</p>
        

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/etihad-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    <p>While its main business is the international air
     transportation of passengers, Etihad Airways also operates
     Etihad Holidays and Etihad Cargo. Supporting these is
     a global contact centre organisation, which is present in four locations, employing over 500 people who speak 11
    languages altogether.</p>
    <p>Furthering its global ambitions and enabling innovation
    in the aviation sector, Etihad Airways started investing
    significantly in major airlines globally. On December 2011,
    it announced the purchase of a 29 percent stake in airberlin,
    Germany’s second largest airline. In January 2012, it acquired
    a 40 percent stake in Air Seychelles Ltd. as part of a strategic
    partnership. The agreement, the first-of-its-kind in Africa,
    includes strategic measures to encourage Air Seychelles’
    long-term commercial growth as well as a comprehensive
    codeshare agreement. In the same year, Etihad Airways
    and Aer Lingus signed a historic interline and codeshare
    agreement alongside a 2.987 percent equity investment in
    the Irish carrier.</p>
    <p>Etihad Airways also acquired an equity stake in Virgin
    Australia Holdings of just over five per cent, to be increased
    to a maximum of 10 per cent in the future. This investment
    in Virgin Australia’s domestic operations significantly
    strengthened the 10-year strategic partnership forged by the
    two carriers in August 2010.</p>
     <p>The airline’s success can be perceived by its continued growth and formidable numbers. It achieved a 31 percent
    increase in its Q2 2012 revenues to US$1.25 billion with
    passenger numbers of 2.55 million, up 34 percent over the
    same period in the previous year. </p>
    
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/etihad-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Recognising its achievements, it has received a range of
    awards that reflect its position as the leading premium airline
    brand in the world. These include ‘World’s Leading Airline’ at
    the World Travel Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011 as well as
    three prestigious commendations at the 2012 Skytrax World
    Airline Awards.</p>
   <p> The group also focuses on sustainability through the
    adoption of a stringent environmental policy, partnership
    with the Masdar future energy initiative and a fuel-efficient
    fleet. It also supports the community via a wide range of
    training opportunities locally and is also a major sponsor in
    the world of sports globally. These include Etihad Stadium,
    F1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Harlequins Rugby
    Football Club and Manchester City Football Club.</p>
   <p> Currently, Etihad Airways serves 86 destinations in 56
    countries with a fleet that is one of the youngest in the world,
    comprising 67 passenger and cargo aircraft. It employs more
    than 9,800 staff representing over 126 nationalities.</p>

   <b>Partners in German aviation growth</b>
        
    <p>When Etihad Airways set out to innovate the global aviation
    industry, it chose Germany for its first equity investment,
    keenly aware of the potential of the European market and
    historic significance of this nation’s engineering excellence.
    In December 2011, it acquired a 29.2 percent stake in
    airberlin – Europe’s sixth largest airline and Germany’s
    second biggest carrier – thereby becoming its single largest
    shareholder.</p>
  <p>  Under the partnership, airberlin now operates daily flights
    from Berlin and Düsseldorf to Abu Dhabi, and additionally
    operates daily services from Abu Dhabi to Phuket in Thailand.
    Etihad Airways codeshares on all airberlin flights to/from
    Abu Dhabi and beyond the four German hubs, providing
    passengers with access to an additional 976 flights per
    week. This, and several other codeshare agreements, give
    Etihad Airwards a combined network of 384 destinations,
    more than any other Middle East airline, thus making it the
    UAE’s modern day success story in the skies.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>The regional aviation sector has seen a select few
    airlines make a mark of the global stage. In each case,
    it has been through a combination of consistent innovation
    and a strong business strategy. These qualities are the
    benchmarks of Air Arabia, whichhas the unique distinction of
    being the first and largest low-cost carrier (LCC) in the Middle
    East and North Africa (MENA) region.</p>
   <p> Comprising a group of airlines, the group also offers travel
    and tourism services worldwide as well as other aviationrelated
    niche services. Starting out with the launch of Air
    Arabia, its current holdings span 7 different companies,
    namely: Air Arabia, Air Arabia (Maroc), Air Arabia (Egypt), Air
    Arabia Centro Hotel, Information System Associates (ICS),
    Sharjah Aviation Services (SAS), Alpha Flight Services and
    Alpha Flight Academy.</p>
  <p>  Air Arabia was established in 2003 as per an Emiri Decree
    by Dr. Sultan Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, the Ruler of Sharjah
    and member of the Supreme Council of the United Arab
    Emirates. Its first flight took off from its main hub in Sharjah,
    UAE on 28 October 2003 to Manama, Bahrain. Having
    achieved profitability from the very first year of being in
    business, it went on to issue a successful initial public offering
    for 55 percent of its stock in 2007 on the Dubai Financial
    Market (DFM), thereby becoming the first airline to go public
    in the Middle East.</p>

    <img src="images/airarabia-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
        <p>Keeping it core proposition in mind, the group has
        extended the values of comfort, reliability and value
        for money across every venture. It started operations in
        Casablanca, Morocco with the inception of Air Arabia (Maroc)
        on 6 May 2009 to serve the mass European market. Moving ahead, it started operations from a third hub in Alexandria,
        Egypt in June 2010, to further increase its reach and provide
        more destinations in the region.</p>
        <p>At the onset of its inception, Air Arabia established
        Information System Associates (ISA) in September 2003 as
        a joint venture with John Keells Holdings (JKH), Sri Lanka’s
        largest conglomerate, to provide IT solutions in the aviation
        industry. Its hi-tech reservation system ‘AccelAero’ is now
        used by several leading LCCs across the world. Sharjah
        Aviation Services (SAS), its joint venture with the Sharjah
        Department of Civil Aviation, supports the ongoing
        expansion of Sharjah International Airport by delivering a
        wide range of passenger, ramp and cargo handling services. </p>
        <p>Further increasing its list of global partners, Air Arabia
        formed Alpha Flight Services with the UK-based Alpha
        Catering Group to offer quality in-flight catering. Keeping
        the future workforce needs in mind, the group started Alpha
        Aviation Academy that provides training and education
        at a multi-million dollar facility in Sharjah. In order to
        complement its airline, Air Arabia announced Centro Rotana
        budget hotel, a 100 percent owned project coming up at
        Sharjah International Airport. </p> 
        <p>The key to Air Arabia’s success has been the ability to
        intelligently diversify and provide low fares by flying to
        secondary airports. The current Air Arabia fleet consists of
        32new Airbus A320 aircraft, aside from an existing confirmed
        order for an additional 44, making it is one of the few LCCs to have a fleet of brand new airplanes.Moreover, all of its
        aircraft are configured with a single cabin and offers spacious
        seating on par with the industry standards for passenger
        comfort.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/airarabia-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>The airline as a brand ambassador for the UAE across
    several destinations has also initiated several corporate
    social responsibility (CSR) programmes. Heading these is its
    Charity Cloud project in collaboration with Sharjah Charity
    International, which aims to raise funds through unique
    ways such as on-board donations. The collected funds are reinvested
    in educational and medical care establishments in
    needed countries across its network.</p>
    <p>Air Arabia’s achievements have earned it consistent
    recognitions from prestigious industry names. The carrier’s
    numerous accolades include the world second best run
    airline by Aviation week in 2012, and the Middle East best
    run company by Euromoney; the World’s Most Profitable
    Airline for 2008 by the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA);
    and World’s Best LCC by Aviation Week in 2009.</p>
    <p>Reflecting its strong financial position, in the quarter
    ending September 30, 2012 Air Arabia reported a net profit
    of Dh226 million, an increase of 126 percent compared to
    the corresponding period in 2011. Currently, Air Arabia flies
    to over 82 destinations in more than 22 countries from its
    three locations with plansto extensively link the Middle East
    and Asia to Europe and Africa through the establishment of
    more hubs.</p>

   <b>Reaching the world from North Africa</b>
        
    <p>North Africa is a strategic market for linking the world to the busy European network and serving the Middle
    Eastern destinations. Recognising the need for comfortable, low-cost travel option in this region, Air Arabia
    launched its second commercial hub at Mohamed V International Airport in Casablanca, Morocco in the year 2009.</p>
    <p>It proved to be a key strategic move, with the new venture expanding rapidly by offering flights to 9 European
    cities in less than 3 months, which now stands at 13 destinations in 11 countries. Furthering its overseas ambitions,
    Air Arabia (Egypt) started its operations in June 2010 as Air Arabia’s third hub, offering flights to 5 cities across
    the region in less than a month.</p>
    <p>Its success in expansion is summed up by the facts thatAir Arabia has safely transported more than 18 million
    passengers since inception and its current staff strength has grown to over 1,000.</p>

        <p>Creating a competitive energetic business and tourism
        environment requires formulation of foresighted
        tactic decisions that result in strategic initiatives that do
        not only promote the location as an attractive business
        destination but also generate economic growth in a longterm
        sustainable pace. In 2008, the Government of Dubai
        and a world’s leading airline Emirates announced the launch
        of Flydubai, a low cost airline model that will carry Dubai’s
        brand and identity.</p>
        <p>It is hard to believe that Flydubai began commercial
        operations on June 1 2009, with such a tremendous pace of
        growth and impact on the regional and international lowcost
        aviation scenes.</p>
        <p>During the initial establishing phase, the airline signed an
        order with the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing for 54
        Next-Generation Boeing 737-800 with approximately a total
        value of USD 4 billion, marking the biggest single order by a
        Gulf-based low cost carrier for the Boeing aircraft. This was
        followed by a package of orders totaling USD 750 million for
        engines and winglets. The size of investments sent a clear
        signal of the company’s commitment towards becoming a
        global competitive player in the budget aviation industry.
        With a confident spirit of exceeding the horizons,
        Flydubai’s scheduled flights commenced with daily flights
        to Beirut and Amman. The selection of these designations
        was a thorough process based on demand figures, cities’
        popularity and bilateral agreements between both countries.</p>

    <img src="images/flydubai-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
    <p>Within a few years of operation, Flydubai has succeeded
    to build an operational network of more than 50 destinations, spanning GCC, Middle East, North Africa, Indian Sub-
    Continent, Asia and Central and Eastern Europe. This has
    not only redefined low-cost travel to the Middle East but
    also set new industry and consumer benchmarks. As a result,
    Dubai International Airport saw a tremendous increase
    in passenger numbers in 2011, 50.98 million passengers,
    making it the fourth largest airport in the world in terms of
    passenger traffic.</p> 
    <p>Flydubai has been reaching different regions within a very
    short time of operation. Destinations that did not have a
    direct route from Dubai are becoming more accessible to a
    greater number of people in the UAE who will now be able
    to take an advantage of the airline’s commitment to making
    travel less expensive. The airline contributed significant
    benefits to different nationalities that live in the UAE. The
    expense of travel is no longer a burden.</p>
    <p>In 2010, the airline’s vision and expansion strategy won
    the backing of investors when Flydubai raised USD 1 billion.
    All the aircraft deliveries due until the end of 2011 have
    been consequently secured, paving the way for the airline
    to confidently launch new routes. 18 new destinations were
    indeed added including flights to Kiev, Kharkiv and Donetsk
    in Ukraine; Ufa and Kazan in Russia; the Georgian capital
    Tbilisi and Belgrade in Serbia; Baghdad and Najaf in Iraq; Taif in Saudi Arabia; Bishkek in Kyrgyz Republic; Sana’a, Yemen
    and Bucharest, Romania, in addition to Skopje, Macedonia.</p>
		
        
     <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/flydubai-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Flydubai’s success was evident by achieving one of the
    best On-Time Performances in the industry (85%), a fleet of
    25 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft and Revenue Per Kilometre
    (RPKMs) increasing 88% in January of the year 2012
    compared to the same period in 2011.</p>
    <p>Among the driving forces behind the airline’s success are
    accessibility, affordability and a USD 20-million maintenance
    and engineering investment program. Firm measures were
    also taken to ensure the best possible passenger experience
    and that each investment is cost-effective and translates into
    savings for passengers.</p>

   <b>Flydubai reaching the former Soviet Union countries</b>
        
    <p>Within just two years, Flydubai has reached different destinations in the Commonwealth Independent States (CIS).
    It has launched direct flights to Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Ukraine, Kazan, Ufa, Yekaterinburg
    and Samara in Russia. The potential growth of these routes has been well-studied and understood by the airline.</p>
   <p> Through providing direct cost-effective flights coupled with good and accessible services, Flydubai succeeded
    in attracting a diversified category of people from businessmen, historical attractions lovers, young couples and
    get-away seekers from the Middle East region to explore these distinguished destinations. Thanks to Flydubai, not
    only the tourism sectors that started to gain a momentum of growth but also Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs)

        <p>RAK Airways is a national Airline of United Arab Emirates
        (UAE) operating from Ras Al Khaimah (RAK), one of
        the seven emirates that make up the UAE. The airline was
        incorporated by a Royal Decree in 2006 in RAK Investment
        Authority (RAKIA) Free Zone and started out with two
        Boeing 757-200 aircrafts. It has an authorized capital of
        AED 1.5 billion. RAK Airways runs on the simple principle of
        customer satisfaction with a focus on value-for-money by
        positioning itself as a viable alternative between full-service
        and low-cost carriers.</p>
       <p> As one of the youngest national carriers of the UAE, it
        received the AOC (Airlines Operating Certificate) in the
        year 2007 and in November 2007, launched the inaugural
        flight to Dhaka. Moving ahead at a steady pace, the airline
        announced the launch of flights to three more destinations,
        namely Colombo, Beirut and Doha were announced.</p>
       <p> With time, RAK Airways secured itself in the regional
        aviation market and in the following year, the company
        signed a deal with Boeing to acquire six 737-800 aircrafts.
        However, the airline had to temporarily discontinue services
        in the year 2009 due to adverse effects of the global financial
        crisis on the aviation industry. Emerging with a stronger
        strategic focus, RAK Airways re-launched operations under
        a new livery in the year 2010 with an aim to provide 	valuedriven flights.</p>

    <p>RAK Airways spread its networks by adding more tactical
    destinations to its name including Chittagong in Bangladesh
    and Kozhikode, a historical city, which was selected as its
    first destination route in India. In order to continuously
    provide more value-added services to passengers, the
    company introduced holiday packages complementing
    its international destinations. Furthering this approach,
    its passengers are also offered substantial free baggage
    allowance as well as free transportation between RAK
    International Airport and other emirates and vice versa, in
    addition to free long-term parking at the airport.</p>
    <p>With increasing success, the airline has seen renewed
    demand from both holiday and business travellers. The
    airline currently flies to ten global destinations across eight
    countries. It aims to launch up to nine new routes, mainly
    focusing on the Indian Subcontinent, GCC, Africa and CIS
    regions.</p>
    <p>It has plans to boost its aircraft fleet. In order to better
    service and manage flights, RAK Airways signed a multi-million Dollar deal with SITA, an IT provider for the Air
    Transport Industry. Further on, RAK Airways has moved
    towards developing its business class offering through the
    launch of RAK Premiere with a commitment to attaining
    high standards while providing competitive fares.</p>
   <p> The growth of social media in the realm of marketing
    and advertising has been phenomenal and the airline was
    quick to notice this opportunity. Which is why, RAK Airways
    emerged as the first Middle Eastern airline to actively use
    this innovation to market its services. It has successfully
    capitalised on platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact
    and connect with its audiences.</p>

    <p>Committed to realising the latent potential of Ras Al
    Khaimah, the emirate’s leadership envisioned strong plans to
    improve the three key sectors in which it has a comparative
    advantage: tourism, real estate and manufacturing. As a
    tourist destination, it has been concentrating on promoting its vast natural sights including the vibrant coastline, the
    majestic Hajjar Mountains, lush stretches of date palms,
    rolling sand dunes and abundant wildlife. It also targets
    to push the number of five-star hotel rooms to 7,500 in
    addition to having at least 30 hotels. Furthermore, the RAK
    International Airport is being refurbished in order to equip
    it to handle more aircraft and passengers, with plans for a
    parallel runway to be built. Strengthening the emirate’s
    vision to progress and promote the nation’s growth, RAK
    Airways continues to play a key role as its high-flying global
    ambassador in the skies.</p>
   <p> RAK Airways runs on a simple principle of customer
    satisfaction with a focus on value-for-money by positioning
    itself as a viable full service carrier with hot meals onboard
    and 30 ilkgs baggage. Passengers enjoy free parking at Ras Al
    Khaimah International Airport and free shuttle from selected
    emirates of the United Arab Emirates.</p>

   <b>Connecting to Pakistan’s commercial hubs</b>
        
<p>Making new waves since its re-launch with the choice of destination, in November 2011, RAK Airways expanded
its routes by introducing flights to Peshawar and Lahore in Pakistan. It was highly strategic decision that took into
account the growing trade between the UAE and Pakistan as well as the standing of Peshawar and Lahore as key
commercial hubs. Furthermore, Peshawar is also the second-largest city in Pakistan and is a major contributor to
the trade between the two nations as an ambitious commercial centre.</p>
<p>The decision proved to be right on the mark with the two routes seeing a gradual increase in the number of
passengers, resulting in yet another success for the airline in a short span of time. Currently, RAK Airways offers
three flights every week to these destinations.</p>

        <p>Not many companies can lay claim to a legacy that
        mirrors the birth, rise and triumph of a nation and
        its leaders’ vision. The story of dnata is in many ways the
        story of how Dubai came about to make the UAE proud as
        the regional hub of aviation and logistics. Since its inception
        over 50 years ago as Dubai Airport Operations, dnata, which
        originated as an acronym for Dubai National Air Travel
        Agency, has become a landmark of Dubai’s fast-growing
        economy as the region’s largest travel services company.</p>
      <p>  With specialties in ground handling, travel, cargo and
        flight catering, dnata’s aim has always been to make quality
        air travel in the region a reality through a host of on-ground,
        in-air and behind-the-scene services The company, a
        member of the region’s largest and fastest-growing aviation
        conglomerate, The Emirates Group, comprises diversified
        businesses of 25 separate divisions handling almost every
        aspect of travel, airport and cargo solutions.</p>
      <p>  dnata, as a first-mover, rapidly consolidated its position in
        its home market, building a wide presence throughout the
        UAE, including Sharjah and the northern Emirates. Taking its
        home-grown success abroad, the company spread its wings
        internationally starting in 1993 through a joint venture with
        Gerry’s International in Pakistan. Global expansion was also
        witnessed in 2008 through the acquisition of a 23% share in
        worldwide corporate travel company, Hogg Robinson Group
        (HRG) and 49% acquisition of the global outsource provider,
        Mind Pearl. In December, 2010, Dnata acquired Alpha Flight
        Limited, expanding the company even further to cover 62
        airports in 12 countries.</p>

   <b>Bringing seamless travel to Europe</b>
        
    <p>dnata is an ambassador of innovation and Arabian excellence in the world, marking its presence as a reliable and steadfast partner in success to cities, nations and continents. It brought its expertise to Europe for the first time in the year 2007 with the integration of Jet Aviation Handling AG into its business, servicing over 60 airlines through a comprehensive range of handling services at the prestigious international airports of Zurich and Geneva.</p>
    <p>Building on its ambitious expansion plans, dnata acquired two of the UK’s leading airport operations in 2010, covering plane handling, ramp and cargo services at Heathrow Airport as well as cargo handling services at Manchester Airport. It is also leading a bold move to enhance Heathrow Airport’s air cargo infrastructure with the Dnata City project, a purpose-built cargo logistics centre.</p>
    <p>The company also acquired Aviance’s passenger and ramp handling operations at Heathrow Terminals 3 and 4, re-branding both as dnata. Speeding ahead, dnata acquired a majority stake in Travel Republic, representing one of the biggest transactions in the company’s history.</p>
    <p>Today, Dnata is one of the largest handlers at London Heathrow with 19,000 aircraft turnarounds, over 4 million or 23% of total passenger flights and over 320,000 tons of cargo handled each year. The numbers in Switzerland are equally impressive with over 15,000 aircraft turnarounds, over 2 million passengers served and more than 25,000 tons of cargo handled annually.</p>

        <p>ELR started as part of MMI; the well-known chain in the
        GCC for Trade, Travel, IT, Corporate Services, Leisure,
        Retail and Liquor. In 2001, the Emirates Group acquired
        MMI and in 2007, the leisure operations of the group
        were divested to create a new Limited Liability company,
        rebranded as Emirates Leisure Retail (ELR). The company’s
        core mission is to establish, manage and franchise a vast
        portfolio of restaurants, cafés and leisure facilities in the 	GCC countries and beyond. Based in Dubai, ELR’s operations span
        the adjoining emirates of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, Muscat in
        Oman and most recently Australia.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/emileisure-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
      <p>  The company currently manages and runs several brands
        including home-grown concepts Après, Hey Pesto, Deli
        Express, Bedouinn’s Bistro and The Retreat, Good To Go
        and Left Bank, as well as franchises for well-established
        international brands such as Costa Coffee and the Noodle
        House. The latest addition to ELR’s network is Hudsons
        Coffee in Australia. With such a wide variety of brands and
        specialties, ELR’s business model is built around integrating
        international concepts into the local culture and growing
        them rapidly, whilst preserving the quality and integrity
        of the brand. The company has developed the resources,
        infrastructure and local insights to make continuous growth
        a reality.</p>
	
    <p>Meanwhile, ELR is moving ahead to leverage its local
    expertise and knowledge on the global arena. As part of
    its ambitious expansion plan, the company aims to expand
    in two directions. Firstly, ELR wants to franchise its own brands to suitable partners and associates who share the same vision and ideals. Secondly, the company is looking for further chances to leverage its track record of regional and domestic representations and affiliations to help other international brands establish their presence in the region.</p>
    <p>In Dubai, ELR also manage four restaurants / bars on the
    Palm Jumeirah – Bidi Bondi, Beach House Cabana, Veda
    Pavillion and Barca Club.</p>

    <p>Another active branch of ELR is ELR Events, which is
    designed to deliver high-profile services to clients and
    partners across the UAE. Part of ELR Events’ recent client list
    includes the entire public catering services at the Emirates
    Dubai Rugby 7’s, Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, FIFA World Cup
    Club Championships, Dubai World Championship Golf, the
    Dubai Airshow and all of the international cricket matches

   <b>Sustained growth through expansion</b>
        
    <p>As a practice of ELR’s long experience in managing and running
    coffee shops in the UAE and GCC, the acquisition of Hudsons
    Coffee doesn’t really come as a surprise. With its 60 branches
    across Australia, the Hudsons Coffee brand was a perfect
    match for ELR. Popular in central business districts, airports
    and hospitals across Australia, Hudsons Coffee is usually
    referred to as the original Australian coffee. The acquisition
    of Hudsons Coffee provided new opportunities for the coffee
    brand, including the potential to expand both domestically and
    internationally in the future.</p>
    <p>With 60 outlets across Australia and over 500 staff nationally,
    the Hudsons Coffee acquisition in March 2009 was ELR’s first
    in Australia and part of an ongoing investment programme that
    has also seen ELR Australia launch Left Bank in Melbourne in
    September 2009, followed by the Noodle House.</p>

        <p>In the field of aviation, the UAE - and Dubai, in
        particular-has made quite ambitious strides by placing
        several outstanding companies on the global stage in the last
        decade. Keeping this in focus, DAE Capital has employed an
        innovative business model to build on Dubai’s dynamism and
        continuous growth in aviation. It has, within the span of just a
        few years, emerged to be a reliable partner to airlines across
        the world.</p>
       <p> DAE Capital, the aircraft leasing and finance arm of Dubai
        Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), was established in 2007 with the
        goal to become the largest aircraft leasing company in the
        Middle East, serving an international market. The company’s
        ambitions are furthered by the expansive reach of its group,
        Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), a globally-recognised
        aerospace company that operates on four continents and
        employs over 4,000 people.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/duaero-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
       <p> The company commenced operations in May 2007 with a
        pathway towards establishing a balanced portfolio of singleaisle
        and wide-body aircraft. Its strategic approach was
        further strengthened by the ability to operate from a central
        hub, which enabled it to provide capital to airlines in the
        region. DAE Capital subsequently launched its international
        presence in the US, The Netherlands and Singapore to meet
        the needs of global airlines. The company steered through
        the global financial crisis and associated downturn in aviation
        by employing a prudent approach.</p>
	
    <p>Now positioned to capitalise on the fast-growing markets
    in Asia and the Middle East, DAE aims to be one of the most
    competent and influential players in the aerospace business.
    The company plans to leverage its proven expertise in the business to share best practices with emerging markets
    and actively participate in shaping the future of the global
    aviation industry. This is evidenced by its expanding presence
    and strong partnerships established with major aircraf-makers
    such as Boeing and Airbus.</p> 
    <p>DAE Capital continues to accelerate developments in the
    global aerospace industry and is perfectly situated to meet
    the global demand for new aircraft, particularly in the Middle
    East and Asia. Driving DAE Capital’s underlying proposition to
    offer attractive leasing terms, regional experience, preferred
    access to local banks and a customised capital structure, is a
    highly experienced team. It seeks to become an integral part
    of the global aerospace industry and a leading player on the
    world stage in terms of aircraft leasing and finance.</p>

  <p>  DAE Capital continues to offer a synergised cluster of
    aerospace services, allowing customers to benefit from a
    world-class shared knowledge and service pool. Its focus on
    building a world-class aircraft leasing business equipped with
    a state-of-the-art portfolio has been truly successful, and the
    company is well positioned for long-term growth.</p>

    <p>The support and foresighted investment policy of DAE
    Engineering enabled positive growth of StandardAero
    across all aspects of its business. At a time when the
    aviation industry is seen as a highly challenging space for
    investors, DAE’s approach has played a key role in the
    company’s success.</p>
    <p>One of the success stories at DAE Engineering - is highly
    significant as it required persistent work over a decade
    and a half. A milestone was reached in 2012, when
    StandardAero delivered its 4,000th Rolls-Royce AE3007
    engine since the program’s inception in 1997. The delivery
    took place at StandardAero’s Maryville, Tennessee facility
    and the engine was delivered to long-time customer
    Aeroméxico Connect, a Mexico-based regional airline. This
    represented a significant milestone in the capabilities of
    the company’s facility and reinforced the confidence that
    its customers placed in it. This achievement once again
    proved that the company always goes the extra mile to
    achieve excellence and set new benchmarks.</p>

        <p>The rapid economic growth in the emirate of Abu Dhabi
        has been observed from sector to sector as an evident
        result of the government’s promise to continue supporting
        the non-oil sector by utilizing the huge oil revenues. The
        exhibitions industry emerged as an implementation of this
        long-term diversification strategy and of the emirate’s vision
        to become a prime global events destination. Meeting the
        increasing demand of this growing industry, Abu Dhabi
        National Exhibition Company Group (ADNEC) was launched
        to be a venue development and business management
        company not only in the local market but also with a global
        foresight. The Group’s current portfolio comprises Abu
        Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, ExCeL London, Al Ain
        Convention Centre, Capital Gate, a gravity defying tower and
        a number of hotel projects.</p>

      <p>  The establishment of Abu Dhabi National Exhibition
        Centre in 2002 in the capital city Abu Dhabi marked the
        group’s takeoff on the road of success. Being the largest
        exhibition centre in the Middle East and North Africa region,
        it has created significant international awareness of Abu
        Dhabi in welcoming over one million visitors and hosting
        over 100 events. In addition, phase one of Al Ain Convention
        Centre was opened on May 2011, enhancing ADNEC’s
        presence in the local market. This new centre is a landmark
        project that would draw a wide range of events to Al Ain and
        will play a role in promoting its tourism sector in general.</p>

		
        <p>The group expanded its portfolio beyond managing
        events when it stepped into the real estate sector in 2007. It
        developed the UAE capital city’s iconic and gravity defying
        tower “Capital Gate”. The development includes a five-star hotel and office spaces. The Gate has been built to lean
        18 degrees westwards - more than four times that of the
        world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa, holding the Guinness
        Record for ‘World’s Furthest Leaning Manmade Tower’.
        Another iconic real estate project is Capital Centre which
        will host 7 branded hotels, 5 services apartment buildings,
        3 residential/serviced apartment complexes, and 3 mixed-use developments. The Centre is the world’s first fully
        interconnected exhibition lifestyle destination. In addition
        to Capital Gate and Capital Centre, ADNEC has a number of
        hotels scattered around Abu Dhabi city and its suburbs.</p>

    	<p>In 2011, ADNEC hosted 733 events at its three event
        centers, achieving an increase of 18 per cent over 2010.
        The continuous growth of events’ number and extent is a
        clear indication of the company’s rising prominence in the
        exhibitions industry. ADNEC Group is developing its network
        both through acquisition and construction. The company’s
        objective is to become the world’s leading venue provider
        to the international exhibitions, conferences and live events
        industries by providing consistently high standards of
        venue facilities, management and client relationships and
        capitalizing on the synergies which exist within a global
        venue network.</p>

   <b>Acquiring the UK capital’s largest exhibition centre</b>
        
    <p>Towards building a global network of venues and in line
    with the diversification strategy of Abu Dhabi, ADNEC
    acquired control of the UK capital’s largest exhibition
    centre “ExCel London” in 2008. The acquisition is valued at
    USD 626 million. The acquisition’s decision was based on
    the outstanding profile of the centre. The centre opened
    in 2001 and welcomed over 2,000 live events, including
    The British International Motor Show the London Summit
    and the London Boat Show. The cash pumped to the
    company’s line allowed it to develop a Phase Two which
    consists of one of Europe’s largest auditoriums, UK’s
    largest banqueting hall and other advanced facilities. This
    expansion was more than sufficient to host key events
    for the London 2012 Olympics including. A 4-star hotel
    Aloft London was also developed to be attached to the
    convention center. These developments are with no
    doubts contributing to the growth of the tourism activity
    in the United Kingdom.</p>
   <p> Since ADNEC took ownership, ExCel has received several
    major awards such as London’s Business Venue of the Year
    of 2009 and ten other awards.</p>

        first managed property, Beach Rotana Hotel, a 254-room
        5-star hotel located in Abu Dhabi. As a company that values
        time, Rotana places emphasis on gaining loyalty by offering
        services that are perfectly suited to varied travellers. In order
        to deliver the same, the company has formed a portfolio
        of 9 distinct brands, grouped on the nature of properties,
        facilities and services.</p>
        <p>Its flagship brand, Rotana Hotels and Resorts brings
        together luxury destinations along with some of the world’s
        most renowned restaurant names in the world. These
        properties include Al Murooj Rotana – Dubai; Yas Island
        Rotana – Abu Dhabi; Grand Rotana Resort and Spa – Sharma
        El Sheikh; Gefinor Rotana – Beirut and Afamia Rotana Resort
        - Latakia, to name a few.</p>

       <p> Rotana’s strategic development is orchestrated by a team
        of professionals with exceptional international experience
        and a fundamental understanding of the cultures and
        communities of the MEA region. Its current properties span
        26 cities with new properties set to open in Amman, Abu
        Dhabi, Al Ain, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, Al Khobar, Gurgaon,
        Jeddah, Riyadh, Baghdad, Bahrain, Beirut, Doha, Erbil,
        Iskenderun, Khartoum, Libya, Rabat and Salalah.</p>
      <p>  Arjaan, the new name given to Rotana Suites, aims to bring
        memorable experience through more personal, first-class
        residences, proffering an environment which more closely
        resembles home. These include Hala Arjaan by Rotana – Abu
        Dhabi; Arjaan by Rotana – Dubai; Queen Centre Arjaan by
        Rotana – Damascus and Raouché Arjaan by Rotana – Beirut.</p>
        <p>Fulfilling the requirement for a budget hotel brand that
        maintains high standards, Rotana conceived the brand
        Centro. Following the launch of Centro Yas Island in Abu
        Dhabi, Rotana opened Centro Barsha in Dubai with plans to
        introduce 25 Centro hotels across the MENA region by 2014.
        The company痴 total number of properties in Dubai currently
        stands at 15 - the highest of any operator in the city ・with
        total room inventory in the emirate to 3,795.</p> 
        <p>Showcasing its insightful understanding of the Arabian
        hospitality sector, the company formed a Sharia’a-compliant
        brand, Rayhaan, built around the beliefs and culture of
        guests, while complementing the values of Islamic culture.
        Rose rayhaan by Rotana in Dubai and Al Marwa Rayhaan
        by Rotana – Makkah, are the two key properties currently
        managed under the brand name.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, its Meeting Plus brand embodies a total
        business environment, with many value-added service.
        Additionally, each of its hotels offer comprehensively
        appointed gym and fitness centers under the Bodylines
        brand name. Furthermore, Zen the spa at Rotana offers 
        rejuvenation facilities and holistic therapies from around the
        world.</p>
      <p>  Going beyond just hospitality, it offers 3 different
        programmes under the Rotana Rewards umbrella, the
        first initiative of its kind in the region for a hotel company.
        Keeping up its innovative approach, the company also
        launched a brand new mobile app that enables browsing
        and booking on the go. Rotana also reaches out to the
        surrounding community through its extensive Community
        Social Responsibility (SCR) plan that regularly supports new
        and existing initiatives.</p>
     <p>   Presently, with a tactical and rigorous expansion plan, the
        company is well on its way to achive the aim of forming a
        presence in every major city throughout the MENA region
        within the next five years. Recognising its contribution to
        the regional hospitality sector, Rotana was voted ‘Middle
        East’s Leading Hotel Brand’ at the World Travel Awards 2012,
        achieving this distinction for the sixth year in a row. It was

        <p>If one success story in Dubai would be labeled as ‘the
        Dubai dream’, it would be the story of Khalaf Ahmed
        Al Habtoor; the founder and chairman of Al Habtoor Group.
        In 1970, the young Emirati man resigned from his job as a
        manager and decided to start his own company, Al Habtoor
        Engineering, the cornerstone of today’s Al Habtoor Group.
        The unification of the UAE had inspired Al Habtoor to
        undertake turnkey construction projects throughout the
        country. The new-born company was one of the first to be
        founded under the federation.</p>
      <p>  A diversified conglomerate business empire, Al Habtour
        Group is now operating in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
        Bahrain, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. While it is best
        known for construction of iconic landmarks such as Burj
        Al Arab in Dubai, the group is globally recognized through
        its engagement in over nine industrial sectors; including
        hospitality, automotive, real estate, and insurance.</p>
        
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/habtoor-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
      <p>  Al Habtoor Engineering was later named as Al Habtoor
        Leighton Group; which is currently one of the largest
        construction groups in the whole UAE. The company
        undertook concourse two of Dubai International Airport
        Terminal 3 in addition to a series of similar mega projects
        such as Burj Al Arab, and Madinat Jumeirah in Dubai, the Abu
        Dhabi Officer’s Club building which has one of the largest
        concrete spans in the world, the Zarqa Mein Spa in Jordan,
        besides a large number of projects in Qatar. Al Habtoor
        Leighton is also eyeing a new infrastructure contract in Saudi
        Arabia and two in Oman by the end of 2010.</p>
	
        <p>In addition to its rich construction portfolio, Al Habtoor
        Group has built a similarly rich reputation in other business
        sectors. Hospitality projects are taking the group to Lebanon 
        and most recently to Western Europe where over USD 850
        million were earmarked for acquisition in the region. The
        group already has a chain of hotels with a successful track
        record in the UAE. It currently owns and operates five hotels
        and a catering company in Dubai and two hotels in Beirut
        under the management of Habtoor Hotels LLC.</p>
        <p>Another significantly successful subsidiary of Al Habtoor
        Group is Al Habtoor Auto, which was established in 1983. The
        company currently represents leading automobile brands
        including Mitsubishi, Bentley, Aston Martin and Bugatti.
        Utilizing its well-established network of seven showrooms,
        eight service centers and twelve parts centers that effectively
        cover the entire UAE, Al Habtoor Auto imports over 60,000
        vehicles from Japan every year to cater for the local demand.</p>
        
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/habtoor-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        
        <p>The Group decided to broaden its service range by entering
        the real estate realm. Al Habtoor Real Estate was established
        to take a prominent position in the real estate market. 
        The company manages a respected number of properties in the
        UAE such as Emirates Oasis and Al Wasl Village. Besides
        its active role in real estate, the Group had stepped in two
        sectors; Education, and Publishing. In 1990, the Emirates
        International Schools were established to house over 3000
        students in the latest state-of-the-art facilities that match
        international standards. And in 1993, the Group launched Al
        Habtoor Publishing to produce one of the most respected
        corporate magazines in the Middle East, Al Shindagah.</p>
        <p>With the group’s clear mission of future readiness, Al
        Habtoor’s oversees expansion strategy thrives to provide
        the group itself as well as target countries with sustainable
        solutions for domestic growth. Combining job creation
        opportunities with profitable business developments, Al
        Habtoor Group is also maintaining its founder’s philanthropic
        approach of responsible corporate behavior, which he started
        the very same year he founded Al Habtoor Engineering.</p>

        <p>Flemingo International was established in Dubai in
        1997 as a global travel retail operator with a focus on
        emerging markets. The company’s founders realized the
        potential growth in the traditional trade routes between
        East Africa and the Middle East. Therefore, they commenced
        operations with logistics facilities in Dubai and subsequently
        an outlet in Zanzibar, Africa in 1998.</p>
        <p>Choosing Dubai as the main headquarter by a company
        that was set to be international from the day of inception
        and the successes achieved afterwards illustrate the city’s
        characteristics that make it the right place of doing business.
        Indeed, the company has benefited from the extensive range
        of advantages of being a Dubai-based including the strategic
        location of the city, the enthusiastic business climate etc.
        Since the start, Flemingo’s agile and speedy decisionmaking
        has helped it establish operations in emerging
        markets and partnerships globally. Today, it is a leading
        player in the industry through acquisitions, tenders and joint
        ventures across 3 continents, with around 120 outlets in 26
        different countries.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
     <p>With the beginning of the new millennium, the company
        started expanding its presence in Africa with a UN
        commissary shop in Nairobi and made an entry into the
        Indian duty free market with four concessions.</p>
    
      <p>In 2010, Flemingo also achieved remarkable achievements
        when it entered the European industry by acquiring
        controlling interest in Baltona, followed by its agreement with Iris Ekspres, the Turkish in-flight operator. Through this, Flemingo operates across many different formats such as duty free in airports, borders, downtown, seaports, UN commissary and Luxury retail, travel essential stores, F&B outlets and coffee shops in airports.</p>
	
        <p>In 2013, Flemingo International has received a USD 30
    million investment by a fund managed by Albright Capital
    Management (“ACM”), a dedicated emerging-markets
    investment firm based in Washington, DC and chaired by
    former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright.</p>
    <p>Flemingo has achieved over 50% per year revenue growth
    rate over the past five years by focusing on markets such as
    Africa, Eastern Europe, Turkey and the Indian subcontinent.
    Flemingo has been using the proceeds of the investment to further 	expand its reach in high-growth duty-free markets
    across the globe.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        
        <p>Driven by its objective of targeting 200 + convenience
        outlets by 2018 across emerging markets, Flemingo
        International secured a convenience and coffee concession
        at Senai airport, Johor Baru, Malaysia in 2013. The company
        is operating convenience stores across 26 countries. Lately,
        it opened convenience stores in three Polish airports and in
        Juan Santamaria International Airport in Costa Rica.</p>
       <p> Flemingo has created a strong franchise in the global duty
        free space and is growing fast by replicating skill sets built
        over last decade across emerging markets. Between 2010
        and 2012, it made important acquisitions in Poland, Turkey,
        Romania, Nepal, Ukraine and Cape Verde.</p>

   <b>Flemingo International and the growing success in the Indian subcontinent</b>
        
    <p>Flemingo International has achieved several milestones in the Indian
subcontinent especially after receiving an investment from Samara
Capital Investment, an India-focused private equity fund, in 2007. Since
then, the business has grown multifold, boosting the company’s role
as an emerging-markets focused duty free operator. In 2008, it signed
a joint venture with DFS group to operate the duty free at Mumbai’s
Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, catering to more than 9
million international passengers every year.</p>
<p>In addition, Flemingo caters to approximately 200,000 passengers
every year in Jaipur Airport in the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan.
Flemingo also operates a duty free store at the Bandaranaike
International Airport. It has taken a step further to strengthen its
presence in the region by launching a duty paid distribution brand
in Colombo. Due to the strong fundamentals of the growing tourism
industry in the subcontinent, the potential growth of the UAEbased
duty free operator is promising especially when backed by
entrepreneurial management team.</p>

        <p>An astonishing number of companies in the
        UAE have taken inspiration from the nation’s
        economic diversification initiatives and charted growth in
        numerous sectors. This has resulted in several multi-sector,
        multinational conglomerates emerging from the business
        families that spearheaded growth and innovation. Similar
        among these is Albwardy Investment, which was established
        to be the holding company to oversee a collection of
        investments across diverse industries.</p>
       <p> Today, the group runs companies with varying interests
        spanning sole ownership, joint ventures and equity stakes
        in leisure, food, trade, industry, retail and other many
        other fields. As a company that evaluates every potential
        opportunity that presents itself, it has grown rapidly, which is
        why several of its companies have been operational for over
        35 years. It also flourished rapidly by taking advantage of the
        unrivalled advancement of the UAE’ economy as well as its
        policies of free trade.</p>

        interests in Tanzania through Safari Plus, the country’s first

        group to operate with an extremely small, but efficient head
        office comprising mainly the internal audit team, together

   <b>An eco-friendly haven in Seychelles</b>
        
        <p>As an island country that sets the standard for
        sustainable eco-tourism and is home to two UNESCO
        World Heritage Sites, Seychelles is brimming with
        opportunities in natural tourism and hospitality.
        Expanding its focus on developing the potential of
        Africa, Albwardy Investment took the first step in
        this country by establishing the Four Seasons Resort,
        Seychelles. This award-winning 5-star hotel is located
        on its own private beach offering 67 luxury villas,
        perched on stilts on the jungle hillside or nestled
        amid greenery close to the beach. Additionally, it
        offers exclusive dining destinations, a spa and many
        more amenities. Further complementing this property
        are its Four Seasons Private Residences, Seychelles.
        These freehold luxury fully-furnished villas, built in the
        same style as the resort, have seen high demand and
        emerged as one of the most coveted homes in these
        tropical islands.</p>
       <p> Albwardy Investment, by creating an unrivalled luxury
        hotel experience for tourists through the Four Seasons
        Resort, Seychelles, further expanded its hospitality
        footprint in one of the most challenging market
        that requires complex ecological conservation. This
        landmark development was also voted among the
        Top 25 Luxury Hotels in Africa in the Traveler’s Choice
        Awards 2013, signifying the success of its commitment
        to Seychelles and the continent of Africa.</p>

        <p>The Galadari Brothers group is one of the oldest
        business conglomerates in the UAE, and is responsible
        for grounding the nation’s entrepreneurial vision in the 1960s.
        Its operations span several sectors, and include automobiles,
        industrial manufacturing, media, retail, engineering,
        hospitality, real estate, and travel and tourism. As an
        acknowledgement of the significance of the group to the
        nation’s economic growth in particular, and the GCC region
        in general, the Government of Dubai bought a 30% stake in
        the company in 2006. This made the group well-placed to
        synergise its growth plans with the objectives of the region.</p>
       <p> The Galadari Brothers Group has a presence in most
        aspects of life in GCC region. It connects the personal to the
        corporate and the public, meeting needs at various levels
        along the way. The group consists of several companies
        that operate autonomously within the imperatives of their
        specific sectors while adhering to the larger goals of the
        conglomerate.</p>
      <p>  The group’s contribution to the infrastructural backbone
        of the country has been led by Galadari Engineering
        Works (GEW). Its steelwork division has held up imposing
        constructions, including power plants, bridges, grandstand
        stadiums, shopping malls, and warehouses. Its machine shop
        serves the complex needs of critical industries such as oil and
        gas, cement and construction, and aviation. The ISO 9001
        accreditation, received in 1993, testifies to rigorous quality
        control systems the company has in place to ensure seamless
        participation in such crucial sectors. The company has now
        undertaken an ambitious expansion program in the Dubai
        Industrial City. Over a 1.2 million square feet plot area, the
        company is seeking to expand the production capacity to
        30,000 tons per month.</p>

        <p>The most visible enterprise of the group that signals its vital
        role in the public domain is Khaleej Times, the region’s first
        and leading English daily published by the Galadari Printing
        and Publishing LLC. The daily has been the gold standard in
        journalism in the region and its technological track record
        bears testimony to the cutting-edge capabilities of the print
        infrastructure that serves various other corporate publishing
        needs. The honors list at the Dubai International Print
        Awards, 2011 underlines the extremely sophisticated print
        infrastructure put in place by the newspaper’s publishing
        house, Galadari Printing and Publishing LLC (GPP). Its hattrick
        of awards includes the gold prize for Khaleej Times in
        the print newspaper category.</p> 
        <p>On the road, the group is marked by the presence of
        Mazda vehicles, a leading global brand brought to the UAE
        by Galadari Automobiles Co. LLC. This flagship company
        of the group is the sole distributor of this premium brand
        of automobiles, sustaining a fruitful partnership with the
        Mazda Corporation, Japan for over 35 years.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Galadari’s experience with luxury services is further
    underlined by the Galadari Travel Group. The diverse nature
    of its operations in the travel industry is sustained by three
    separate companies. The International Travel Services (ITS)
    company represents Swiss Tours and is the General Sales
    Agent for Kuoni (India) Ltd., which offers the famous SOTC 
    tours. ITS taps into a network of 3000 hotels worldwide in
    order to meet personal, professional, and corporate-scale
    travel needs. The group’s own Galadari Services Co. hosts
    the Radisson BLU, Dubai Deira Creek, while the group owns
    and manages a luxurious hospitality destination in Sri Lanka.
    It also represents Air India and Jet Airways in the emirate of
    Ajman.</p>
    <p>In order to meet the internal infrastructural needs of
    such a large group of companies, Galadari Real Estate owns
    and leases out real estate properties to the various group
    companies at market rates. The real estate managed includes
    commercial, industrial, and residential properties. </p>

   <b>Taking hospitality to the East</b>
        
    <p>In order to expand further into newer sectors and
    buoyed by the nation’s popularity for hospitality,
    Galadari Group took this first step beyond UAE
    into Sri Lanka. The group is the promoter and the
    majority shareholder of Galadari Hotel (Lanka)
    Ltd., which is also managed by its subsidiary.</p>
   <p> The Galadari Hotel is situated in the heart of
    Colombo. Overlooking the Serenity of the Indian
    Ocean, and situated in the midst of the Business
    District the Galadari Hotel Colombo is an Elite
    500-Room Property positively positioned in
    the Corporate Community over the past decade
    as the ‘Businessman’s Home in Colombo’. The
    comprehensive facilities, dining choices and
    impressive location have made it a very attractive
    proposition for the discerning traveler. This
    success helped Galadari Brothers strike an
    impressive balance between business and leisure
    at a highly preferred destination overseas.</p>

        the guiding force for the brand. Today, it is synonymous
        with exceptional service, respect for local traditions and
        harbinger of innovation. Following the expansive growth in
        the nation’s growing property sector, the group established
        Reef Real Estate Investment during 2004 with a diverse
        range of activities spanning real estate, investment, property
        management and property development.</p>

        <p>Further on, MANAFA LLC acquired a major stake in

   <b>Innovating hospitality in the GCC and beyond</b>
        
        <p>As a proud representative of the success of the Dubai business model abroad, Hospitality Management
        Holdings (HMH) has been spreading the expansion of MANAFA LLC into the region. Starting with a focus on
        high-growth markets of the GCC, it has marked a presence in North Africa and the Levant regions with its
        four well-positioned brands.</p>
       <p> One of its greatest success stories internationally is Corp Executive Hotels, a brand that has been conceived
        for savvy business and leisure travellers, it has rapidly positioned itself as a formidable player in the Middle
        East region with several projects under development including one in KSA and another in Jordan. In addition,
        it has three properties operational – two in Dubai and one in Riyadh. Keeping with the brand’s philosophy
        of promoting art and culture, while integrating with the local community and generating environmental
        awareness, each of its hotels is designed to help create a better world for future generations.</p>
       <p> Moreover, HMH has been at the forefront of adopting industry best practices as well as developing innovative
        brands, products and programs. It was the first to have an alcohol-free chain in the Middle East with Coral
        Hotels & Resorts offering a family-friendly ambience. The group has also ensured continued growth by
        foreseeing the demand for budget and mid-market hotels in the region, mirroring the budget travel choices
        offered by airlines. Taking a step forward in this direction it introduced ECOS Hotels, the Middle East’s first
        eco-friendly budget hotel brand.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>Waha capital stands as one of the notable and distinct
        investment holding companies in the Emirate of Abu
        Dhabi, both in the sectors it invests and engages in and in
        being the largest and most diverse public investment holding
        company listed in the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. The
        group now stands at the threshold of significant planned
        growth as it looks to double its assets over the next five years.</p>
       <p> The company started in 1997 as Oasis Leasing with a
        simple but winning formula. Demand for aircrafts, among
        other big ticket assets like ships, vessels and infrastructure
        components, was expected to grow rapidly not only in the
        GCC and MENA region but across the globe. At the time,
        there were no regional players that provided customers
        with a one-stop solution for their varying aircraft and big
        ticket assets leasing needs. Oasis Leasing (now named Waha
        Leasing) competently occupied this carefully selected niche
        with clear success.</p>
       <p> Waha Leasing is now at the core of Waha Capital’s
        business model and growth drivers. Waha today owns leases,
        manages or has a financial interest in a portfolio of more
        than 100 aircrafts valued at over USD 4.3 billion, putting
        the company at the leading edge to provide regional and
        international airlines with the right solution at the right time.
        Waha Leasing’s list of clients currently includes top league
        airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Air
        Canada and Malaysian airlines. Through offering a diverse
        range of leasing options that suit the needs of regional and
        internal clients, Waha Leasing and Waha Capital aim to play
        a vital role in realising the Abu Dhabi 2030 economic vision,
        which regards aviation as a major pillar of Abu Dhabi’s
        economy and sees the Emirate as a key global player across
        the different sectors of the aviation industries’ international
        value chain.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/wahacap-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
        <p>Because Abu Dhabi’s economic strategy is ambitious, the
        Waha team have constantly been looking for opportunities
        to contribute to the Emirate’s and the nation’s economy in
        a unique and value-adding way. This drive was the key to the
        company being listed in the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange
        (ADAX) in 2001 and to the strategic decision of turning Waha
        into an Investment Holding Company in 2008.</p>
       <p> Along with Waha Leasing, Waha established three
        other subsidiaries targeting key growth sectors locally and
        internationally. Seeing the growth in demand and the need
        for modernisation and improvement across the Oil Supply
         Vessels industry (OsVs) in the GCC and Caspian region, Waha
        established Waha Maritime to make strategic investments
        and utilise the opportunities in this niche as well as other
        niches in the marine and shipping industry. Taking advantage
        of its healthy financial situation, Waha Marine expects to
        make a difference in the regional (OsVs) scene by being able
        to invest in companies and assets, help in modernising fleets,
        and introduce new and competitive technologies into those
        highly important assets in the oil industry.</p> 
        <p>The company made its first successful investment in 2008
        by acquiring a significant stake in GMMOS Group, a major
        industrial holding company operating in the Marine, Oil
        and Gas and Crane-hire sectors across the high-growth Gulf
        and Caspian markets. Waha also established Waha Financial
        Investments (WFI), a company that intends to provide
        specialised banking services through the establishment of
        financial institutions, acquisitions and joint ventures. Its
        primary purpose is to support the company and Abu Dhabi
        government in achieving their goals through providing
        various financial products and services. Waha Capital,
        through its financial services arm, has been able to arrange
        significant deals for the UAE armed forces and is given
        mandate to arrange similar, large-scale finance for the Army
        and other government bodies in Abu Dhabi and the UAE.</p>
        
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/wahacap-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    <p>In spite of its regional focus, Waha is also keen to contribute
    to the internal, organic growth of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi
    as it actualises its ambitious economic vision. Waha Land,
    a specialised subsidiary aiming at multi-purpose property
    development, was established in late 2008. Almarkaz, a
    mixed-use industrial project located strategically along the
    railway line, is intended to link the entire country by 2014.
    The project will be built in three phases and will cost USD 4
    billion.</p>
   <p> The word synergy is at the heart of the structure and
    management approach of Waha Capital. In spite of its
    diversified nature and strong international presence,
    Waha’s top management asserts that all business units and
    subsidiaries contribute to the success of the overall group,
    conducting projects and operations that are linked to the core
    areas in which Waha operates. This can be demonstrated in
    the case of Waha Financial Investments, where Waha realised
    that many of its government and corporate clients in Waha
    Leasing, both regionally and internationally, need assistance
    with arranging financing for their Asset Leasing needs. WFI
    helps to arrange this financing through its network and
    leverages its capital wealth and its ownership of its assets to
    achieve this objective.</p>

   <b>Thinking differently in times of turmoil</b>
        
        <p>In the last couple of years, the entire globe went through an
        unprecedented financial and business downturn that has not been
        experienced for almost a century. It was natural, therefore, for many
        businesses to suffer in these challenging conditions, while a few
        businesses were able to flourish. Driven by its quest for innovation
        and ongoing ability to identify unique niches to cater to in all its
        areas of operations, Waha Capital, through its Waha Leasing
        subsidiary, was among these few, through entering a totally new
        and highly growing segment in the middle of the global crisis.</p>
       <p> Seeing the long-term upwards trend in global air travel in general,
        Waha Leasing realised that the global financial conditions and
        the increasing ability of new segments of the world’s population
        to afford flying is creating a new opportunity, namely low-cost
        airlines. Such airlines rely heavily on using smaller aircrafts, a more
        financially feasible strategy to ensure the success of their business
        model. Taking these facts into account, Waha have made a highly
        strategic move by acquiring a 50 percent stake in AerVenture
        Holding, a global company focusing on owning and leasing Airbus
        A320 family aircraft.</p>
      <p>  Established in 2006, AerVenture currently has a total asset base
        of USD 2.4 billion. Its fleet consists of 22 aircrafts with firm orders
        of 32 more aircrafts. AerVenture is now managed in partnership
        between Waha Leasing, a subsidiary of Waha Capital, and AerCap
        Limited N.V AerVenture, a global leader in providing aviation
        solutions for operators and carriers. This partnership helps
        leverage the expertise of Aercap and expand the global reach of
        AerVenture, particularly in emerging regions such as the Middle
        East and Africa.</p>
       <p> Waha Capital, through its different subsidiaries, has proven that it
        can take a lead in creating new business opportunities in the time
        of crisis. The AerVenture Holding deal provides only a glimpse at
        one of the pioneering deals made by Waha Maritime, Waha Land
        and Waha Financial Investments.</p>
