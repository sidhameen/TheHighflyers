    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>The Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA)
remains one of the most distinguished UAE-based
global investors. The company was founded in 2005 when the
Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) privatized
its power and water assets. Even though the company has
significantly grown in a remarkable fast pace and stepped into
five different continents – North America, Europe, Africa and
Asia, retaining its position as the premier energy company in
the home market remains of such immense importance.</p>

<p>Today, TAQA is responsible for 98% of the emirate’s water
and electricity needs. In total, it owns seven plants in the UAE,
producing nearly 10,783 mega watts of power and 787 million
imperial gallons of water a day of desalination capacity. With
a combined total of over USD 23.4 billion in assets, TAQA
enjoys a stable fiscal position, which does not only enable
the company to operate with confidence but also to expand
regionally and globally.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/taqa-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->

<p>TAQA has divided its operations into three business
lines, namely; downstream, midstream and upstream, since
operating at a global level has been its primary goal, matching
the company’s commitment towards becoming a global
integrated energy provider. In the upstream sector, TAQA
operates in the exploration and production of crude oil and
natural gas fields, which take the company to the Netherlands,
UK, Canada and the US.</p>

<p>Midstream operations in TAQA were designed to become
the company’s logistics arm in terms of storage, transportation
and processing infrastructure. This is demonstrated by the
company’s growing portfolio of midstream assets in the
UK and Dutch North Sea and the ongoing creation of the
Bergermeer Gas Storage Consortium.</p>

<p>This business line enjoys increasing popularity because it
handles end-user energy needs, from Water Desalination to
Power Generation. Not only does it provide the UAE’s capital,
Abu Dhabi, with 90 percent of its daily electricity and water
needs, but it is also expanding globally with operations in
India, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Ghana.</p>

<p>To provide further flexibility for its operations, some of
these business lines are operated through TAQA-owned local
entities; TAQA North, TAQA Bratani, TAQA Europa and TAQA
Energy.</p>

 <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/taqa-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>In August 2007, TAQA stepped into North America
by acquiring Northrock from Pogo Producing Company
and amalgamated with TAQA North. The company has
subsequently entered into agreements to acquire Pioneer
Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of US-based Pioneer Natural
Resources Company, and Calgary-based PrimeWest Energy
Trust. Today, TAQA North has a diversified asset base with
operations in both Canada (British Columbia, Alberta and
Saskatchewan) and the United States (Montana, North
Dakota and Wyoming).</p>

<p>TAQA Bratani, another subsidiary of TAQA and one of
the fastest-growing exploration and production companies
working on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf UKCS, was
established to build a long-term future for TAQA’s growing
North Sea portfolio which began when the group acquired
Talisman’s interest in the Brae Complex which included the
SAGE pipeline and onshore terminal. In 2008, TAQA acquired
a 100% interest in the Northern North Sea Tern, Kestrel, Eider,
Cormorant and Pelican Fields, a combined 26.73% interest
in the Dana operated Hudson field and a 24% interest in the
Sullom Voe Terminal. In addition, TAQA Bratani operates the
Brent System on behalf of itself and co-venturers in the North
Sea.</p>

<p>TAQA’s expansion into new markets partially through
acquiring stakes in major operating companies in the field
of oil and gas continued to flourish. TAQA Energy B.V. was
established in Netherlands to explore and produce gas and
condensates from wells located onshore in the Alkmaar
region and offshore in the Dutch North Sea. In 2009, TAQA
Energy acquired DSM Energie Holding, a Dutch oil production
company.</p>

<p>In India, TAQA has sat up the expansion plans for its power
plant in Neyveli in order to double its capacity from 250
Mega Watts to 500 Mega Watts. The plant is planned to be
operational by 2015. Currently, the 250 Mega Watts lignitefired
plant is supplying its entire electricity generation to the
Tamil Nadu Electricity Board under a thirty year agreement.
The plant is owned and operated by ST-CMS Electric Company
Private Limited which is 100% owned by TAQA.</p>

<p>Regionally, TAQA holds strategic shares in a number of
leading energy companies. In Saudi Arabia, it is a major
shareholder in Jubail Energy Company which owns the Jubail
Cogeneration Plant, a 250 MW plant that began providing
energy to the SADAF Petrochemical Plant in 2005. In Oman TAQA acquired a 40% interest in SOHAR Aluminium including
the 1,000 MW captive combined cycle power station. The
Sohar aluminium power plant powers the company’s
aluminium smelter operations which produce 350,000 tonnes
of the metal each year.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/taqa-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>The acquisition of Jorf Lasfar Energy Company, JLEC,
Morocco’s first independent power producer, also provides a
clear example of the way TAQA paves its way as a responsible
global power company. While the acquisition itself serves a
business purpose, the deal enabled TAQA to actually double
the production capacity of JLEC, thus furthering the reach
of the national electricity network in Morocco and helping
millions of people make better use of energy in their daily lives.
Because of the dynamic nature of the Moroccan economy,
the expansion of JLEC plants has a direct positive effect in
the central region of this North West African country. From a
business perspective, JLEC emerges as an example of TAQA’s
merger, negotiation and project management capabilities.
Two new coal fired units of 350MW each are expected to
become fully operational by the end of 2014.</p>

<p>In addition to its strong background backing, TAQA
developed its own philosophy of financial stability and
business growth. The company remains committed to the
principle of diversifying its overall revenue mix to mitigate
risk and provide greater stability and flexibility through
lower commodity price cycles. Being a worldwide energy
provider, TAQA’s commitment to continual and sustainable
improvements in HSSE (health, safety, security and
environmental performance), is demonstrated through
a worldwide internal program to establish and maintain
common HSSE procedures and standards. Today, almost all
TAQA operations are either recommended for international
certification (such as ISO 14001) or granted global recognition
based on external audits (such as the WORK SAFE ALBERTA
award).</p>

            <p>The Bergermeer gas storage plant
            in Alkmaar in the Netherlands is one
            of TAQA’s marque projects after
            receiving approval from the Dutch
            government in May, 2012.</p>
            <p>When the facility is completed in 2015,
            it will be one of the largest in Europe,
            storing up to 4.1 billion cubic metres
            of gas, which would heat 2.5 million
            households in the Netherlands. It will
            also double the Netherlands’ storage
            capacity and turn the country into a
            major gas hub in northern Europe.</p>
            <p>The scale of the project in Alkmaar,
            40 km north of Amsterdam, is
            immense. With project partner EBN,
            TAQA will invest EUR 800 million
            in drilling 14 new wells, building
            a gas treatment installation and
            constructing pipelines.</p>
            <p>During construction, more than 1,200
            people will directly work on the
            project.</p>

   <b>Taqa: Increasing footprint in Africa</b>
        
            <p>TAQA has increased its global
            footprint in Africa by buying a
            leading power company in Ghana.
            The Takoradi International Company
            operates the Takoradi 2 Power Plant
            in Takoradi, 200 km west of Accra.
            The facility has been converted from
            oil to gas in a bid to reduce CO2
            emissions. Last year, TAQA received
            government approval and agreed
            new financing to expand the plant,
            which produces 15% of Ghana’s
            energy needs CHECK.</p>
            <p>The project will increase output from
            220 MW to approximately 330 MW
            without requiring additional fuel.
            This will add 50% more capacity
            without increasing CO2 emissions.</p>

        <p>Dana Gas PJSC is the Middle East’s first and largest
        regional private sector natural gas company. It was         established in late 2005 as part of an initial public offering on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange (ADX). There were 400,000
        investors from over 100 nationalities making it one of the
        region’s most successful initial public offerings. The Company
        is headquartered in Sharjah, UAE and possesses a network
        of offices in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kurdistan Region of Iraq
        and Egypt. It currently has assets and projects in oil and gas
        exploration and production, processing, transportation and
        marketing in several countries and aims to play a major role in
        the rapidly growing natural gas business through the Middle
        East, North Africa and South Asia region across the entire gas
        value chain.</p>
<p>Dana Gas continues to expand its business interests in
the gas sector throughout the region, including upstream
exploration and production and downstream gas-related
industries. The company is also building important strategic
alliances and partnerships at both the regional and
international level. Acquisition of strategically important
assets in new and growing gas markets is an important part of
Dana Gas’ objectives.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>The Company has accomplished a number of significant
business development activities including securing strategic
positions in existing projects, entering into strategic alliances
and developing new opportunities in related fields with first
class partners.</p>
<p>In 2007, Dana Gas accomplished its most significant
transaction to date acquiring Centurion Energy International
Inc. Centurion had exploration and production interests in
Egypt, Tunisia and Offshore West Africa. Centurion exited
the interests in Tunisia and West Africa and the company was
re-named “Dana Gas Egypt”. Dana Gas operates across three
geographical locations: Egypt, the Kurdistan region of Iraq
and UAE.</p>
<p>In Egypt, Dana Gas is 100% operator and currently
produces from 11 fields in the Nile Delta and is 50% operator
and producer, alongside Sea Dragon Energy, from one field in
Upper Egypt. During 2011, Dana Gas Egypt produced 77.67
billion cubic feet of gas and 2.6 million barrels of liquids. The
focus for 2012 was to drill 9 additional exploration wells, tie in
additional production from Nile Delta gas fields and expand
the capacity of the El Wastani gas plant in the Nile Delta region.
In addition, Dana Gas has a 26.4% stake in an LPG extraction
plant at Ras Shukheir on the Gulf of Suez that is expected to
came on stream in the second half of 2012.</p>
<p>In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Dana Gas holds a 40%
interest in Pearl Petroleum Company (PPCL) with three
other shareholders – Crescent Petroleum (40%), OMV (10%)
and MOL (10%). Crescent and Dana Gas jointly operate the
Khor Mor Field producing gas, condensate and LPG. The gas
is supplied to two power stations in the Kurdistan Region of
Iraq. In 2011, two LPG trains were commissioned, the first
started LPG production in January and the second in June
and the Company achieved an average production rate for
the year of 23,700 boepd. Longer term plans are to increase
production capacity to meet local gas requirements and for
export regionally and to Europe.</p>

    <img src="images/danagas-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Dana Gas has Sharjah Offshore Concession. The concession
contains the Zora gas field, currently under development. The
targeted production is 50 to 60 millions of standard cubic feet
per day. Dana Gas also owns a major 600 million of standard
cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of gas sweetening and sulphur
production plant, and a major onshore and offshore gas
pipeline system with a capacity of 1000MMscfd, through its
wholly owned subsidiaries, SajGas and UGTC respectively.
Additionally, Dana Gas owns a 35% interest in Crescent
Natural Gas Corporation Limited (CNGCL), the marketing
organisation. CNGC holds long-term gas off-take agreements
with the electricity and water authorities and with major
industrial corporations in the UAE.</p>
<p>Dana Gas is expanding its activities in all elements of the
natural gas value-chain, including upstream exploration
and production; through the midstream transmission and
distribution of gas including LNG trading; and downstream
into gas-related industries and petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Dana Gas seeks an active role as an agent of change and
wishes to contribute to the development of the communities
in which it operates. The company’s CSR programme is about
directly contributing to economic and social development
in a way that safeguards the natural resources and the
environment whilst respecting the rights of each individual.
The company has undertaken CSR activities since its
establishment and prides itself in continuing along this path
despite the financial crisis.</p>

    <img src="images/danagas-4.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
<p>Dana Gas’s contributions focused on the environment,
education, sports, health and sustainable community
businesses. One of the programmes is “education on
environment”, which works closely with Bee’ah, a public
private company in partnership with the city of Sharjah on
a comprehensive bilingual (Arabic & English) programme
to educate the school children in the importance of caring
for the environment, waste management and the three R’s:
reduce, recycle and re-use. The work takes the form of both
interactive sessions with pupils as well as the provision of
digital tools to teachers enabling the company to reach over
100,000 students of grades 1 to 12 residing in the UAE. Dana
Gas is also the sponsor of the “Dana Gas Chemical Engineer
Chair” at the American University of Sharjah, where it works
closely with the university to develop cutting-edge research in
the field of oil and gas engineering.</p>

   <b>catalyst for Kurdistan’s economic development</b>
        
<p>In April 2007, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum signed longterm
agreements and a Strategic Alliance Protocol with the
Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq to appraise, develop,
process and deliver 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas
supplies from the Khor Mor Gas Field urgently needed for power
generation. Dana Gas, with its partners Crescent Petroleum, OMV
(Austria) and MOL (Hungary), has invested approximately USD
930 million in the project, this involved the construction of 180km
of pipelines and two LPG processing trains at the Khor Mor Field.
The project will sustain two power plants to generate 1250 MW
providing cost effective electricity for 4 million Iraqi’s, freeing the
extra 300 MW of electricity to other provinces, saving Iraq USD
2.5 billion a year in imported fuels and creating 2000 new jobs.</p>
<p>The first phase of the project was accomplished within record
time, highlighted by the servicing and completion of the
wells, laying the pipeline across challenging mountainous and
hazardous terrain and the installation of brand new processing
facilities. 50,000 tonnes of equipment were imported, with the
first gas production commencing on 5 October 2008.</p>
<p>Today, the Kurdistan region enjoys 24 hours per day of reliable
electric power, as compared to barely two hours per day before
the company’s investments. This electricity supply has powered
rapid development of the regional economy and is a major factor
in Kurdistan outpacing the development in the rest of federal
Iraq.</p>
<p>The partnership will also appraise the potential of the Chemchemal
Gas Field for development, as part of their strategy to advance
regional economic benefits through development of the region’s
substantial gas resources. Khor Mor and Chemchemal are major
gas fields in northern Iraq.</p>

International Inc. At the time, Centurion had
exploration and production interests in Egypt,
Tunisia and offshore West Africa. The acquisition
greatly enhanced Dana Gas’s international standing
and gave it entrance into Egypt’s gas market.
Subsequently, Dana Gas has exited the blocks in
Tunisia and West Africa, and has renamed Centurion
to Dana Gas Egypt.</p>
<p>At the time, in Egypt, the company was involved
in upstream activities in two exploration blocks in
the Nile Delta region and an exploration block in
Upper Egypt. Since the acquisition, the company
has appraised, developed and delivered on their
promise to expand their Egyptian operations. In
2008, it announced an exploration and development
programme involving 19 new wells with an
investment of $170 million. This aggressive drilling
campaign proved successful, with eight discoveries
in 2009 and a total of 16 onshore gas fields now
discovered, and 11 of which are fully developed
and producing. An oil discovery was made in the
Upper Egypt region, which is now the first and only
commercial oil production in the province. Dana Gas
Egypt and Sea Dragon Energy share the operator
role in the jointly-owned Kom Ombo concession
where the Al Baraka oil field is located.</p>

        <p>The GCC region is known as much for its rich energy
resources as its expertise in the exploration and
production of the same. The United Arab Emirates, as one of
the most diversified economies within this region, has taken
significant steps towards enabling sustainable growth of
the energy sector at home and encouraging entrepreneurial
ambitions, while sharing its capabilities with the world at
large.</p>
<p>Among the pioneers in the nation’s thriving oil & gas
sector is the Sharjah-headquartered Crescent Petroleum. It
is the oldest private exploration and production company
in the Middle East, with over 40 years of experience as an
international operator in numerous countries including Egypt,
Pakistan, Yemen, Canada, Yugoslavia, Tunisia, Argentina, in
addition to its continuing operations at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>It is part of the Crescent Group, one of the most
progressive business groups in the Middle East & North Africa
(MENA) Region, operating through more than 25 diversified
companies across energy and non-energy sectors and has an
international presence in over 20 countries across the globe.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/crescent-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Crescent Petroleum has been operating as a regional
upstream oil & gas company in the UAE. The company began
its activities in the early 1970s and was the first regional,
independent, privately-owned Middle Eastern petroleum
company to engage in the acquisition, exploration and
development of petroleum concessions as well as the
production and sale of crude oil, petroleum products and
natural gas.</p>
<p>This forerunner traces its origins to
Buttes Gas & Oil Co. International Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary and holder
of a Concession granted in 1969 by
the Sharjah Government, pursuant to
which the Mubarek Field was discovered
offshore Sharjah in the early 1970s.
By the mid-eighties, the Crescent
Petroleum Group was fully established,
appropriately reorganised, and making
its mark on the international energy
scene.</p>
<p>Crescent Petroleum’s continued search
for, and identification of, opportunities in
the oil & gas sectors resulted in securing
numerous international oil concessions
worldwide. At the end of the 1980s it
held concessions in Argentina, Canada,
Yugoslavia, France, Tunisia, UAE, and
in the 1990s, added to these with concessions in Egypt,
Pakistan and Yemen.</p>
<p>For regulatory and other purposes, Crescent Petroleum
has created special-purpose vehicles for each of its key
operations. By adopting this structure it has enabled the
company to achieve flexibility, transparency and efficiency
of its operations. Crescent Petroleum has also been
instrumental in establishing Dana Gas PJSC which is the
first major private sector natural gas resource enterprise to
be established in the Gulf Region and currently owns and
operates assets in Egypt, the UAE and the Kurdistan Region
of Iraq.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/crescent-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Crescent Petroleum’s current focus is upon energy
opportunities in the Middle East, specifically within the Gulf
region, but more widely also encompassing North Africa, the
Caspian Sea region and South Asia. Because of this focus,
and its long history of regional operating experience, it is
intimately familiar with business in this region.</p>
<p>Its success in the energy industry across the region goes beyond the function of being technically, commercially and
financially sound, but encompasses an in-depth knowledge
and understanding of the cultural context within which
business is conducted. Furthermore, Crescent Petroleum’s
powerful network of relationships, both across the region
and globally, provides it with a distinct advantage in
concluding deals. </p>
<p>The particular area of focus for the long-term growth
of Crescent Petroleum’s business is the development,
marketing and utilisation of natural gas assets in the
region. Crescent Petroleum has pioneered this role since
the mid-1980s within this vital hydrocarbon rich region of
the world, which contains over 40% of global gas reserves,
by successfully implementing the first two cross-border
pipeline deals in the region.</p>
<p>Crescent Petroleum has, over the years, built up a
competent and internationally-experienced team of
energy professionals, enabling it to operate projects which
are challenging from the geological and engineering perspectives. Through its expertise and established
logistical support base, the company has also been able to
demonstrate its proven track record of project management
on behalf of other oil companies in an efficient and costeffective
manner.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/crescent-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Furthermore, it continues to participate in the global oil &
gas industry with a particular focus on the region comprised
of the countries within the Middle East, North Africa and
South Asia (MENASA). As the world energy consumption
projections continue to see a rapid upward trend, Crescent
Petroleum is well-prepared to meet a significant percentage
of the needs, while ensuring an optimal utilisation of
resources.</p>

   <b>Leading energetically from the capital of Iraq</b>
        
<p>UAE and Iraq have been natural trading and investment
partners with trade between the countries dating back
to historical times and growing year-on-year. Paralleling
the close relations between the two nations, Crescent
Petroleum is the only international oil company to have
had a continuous presence in Baghdad for almost 20
years. The Company has been actively engaged with
the Iraqi Ministry of Oil since the late 1980s, having
carried out studies and training as well as completed
a full field development plan for the Ratawi oil field in
Basra province. Ratawi is one of the major super-giant
fields with over 10 billion barrels of oil in place that are
earmarked for speedy development to boost the oil
production capacity of Iraq.</p>
<p>The company’s reputation can be gauged by the fact that it was one of the select international oil companies
encouraged to visit Baghdad to negotiate petroleum development contracts for over ten giant undeveloped
fields each with indicated reserves between one and ten billion barrels. In 2005, Crescent Petroleum signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Oil Exploration Company (OEC) of Iraq, a division of the Iraqi
Ministry of Oil, which was one of the first agreements of its kind with a Middle Eastern petroleum company. The
MOU covers technical co-operation and training and includes an exploration and appraisal study in southern Iraq.
Crescent Petroleum, in partnership with its affiliate Dana Gas, is currently implementing a major integrated natural
gas project in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has plans on the anvils for utilising currently flared gas and launching a Basra Gas City project on
an even larger scale than the one in Kurdistan. As of now, its continuous presence has grown to include offices in
Baghdad, Erbil and Basra, all staffed 100% by qualified and experienced Iraqis</p>

   <b>Bridging the energy-rich region with South Asia</b>
        
<p>South Asia is a huge and growing energy market, while the GCC
region has several proven gas reserves that could meet this need.
Crescent Petroleum identified the potential of the enormous gas
reserves of the North Field of Qatar to meet the needs of this
important market.</p>
<p>Showcasing a major private sector initiative to focus on commercial
fundamentals, Crescent Petroleum’s launched the Gulf-South Asia
Gas Project (GUSA). It was the first workable scheme for producing,
transmitting by pipeline and delivering natural gas from Qatar to
Pakistan and eventually to other parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Crescent Petroleum is the developer and lead sponsor for this
project. The Company has successfully advanced the GUSA Project
to its present state of pre-implementation maturity including
completing a detailed route survey for the whole pipeline route
from source in Qatar to its final destination in Pakistan.</p>
<p>It comprises two main parts: the upstream development to produce
the gas at the source in Qatar and the pipeline, which will transport
the gas to Pakistan. The former part includes the development
of a sector of the North Field of Qatar to produce natural gas
of up to 1600 MMscfpd of pipeline quality gas for export to the
Bridging the energy-rich region with South Asia
Pakistan markets. While the pipeline between Qatar and Pakistan, being 1,186 kilometres in distance, supports the
economics of a large diameter pipeline project.</p>
<p>The company’s has to-date invested over US$ 30 million in this significant project, which carries enormous
environmental benefits, regionally and globally. It has successfully completed the engineering design of the pipeline,
while the routing of the pipeline based on a detailed onshore and offshore route survey is currently under progress.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
            <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) was established 	in 1971 as the investment arm of the Government of Abu Dhabi in the exploration and production of crude oil and gas, oil and natural gas processing, chemicals and petrochemicals, maritime transportation, and refined products distribution. After four decades of excellence in operations, ADNOC has become one of the world’s largest oil exploration and production companies.</p>
            
<p>ADNOC’s position is dependent and closely linked to the
strategic role the United Arab Emirates plays in the global oil
and gas scene. The UAE is the world one of the world top 10
crude oil producers and so exporters. As of 2009, the UAE’s
proven oil reserves were estimated to be 97.8 billion barrels.
Abu Dhabi leads the other emirates, which make up the UAE
federation, with 92.2 billion barrels, followed by Dubai with
four billion barrels, Sharjah with 1.5 and Ras Al Khaimah with
100 million barrels.</p>
<p>The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC), chaired by His
Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of
the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, formulates and oversees the
implementation of Abu Dhabi petroleum policies.</p>
    
<p>ADNOC is given over 60 per cent of the petroleum and
gas projects in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. ADNOC’s efforts
in the exploration and production field have concentrated on
assessing undiscovered reserves and optimizing hydrocarbon
recovery by improving the reservoir management. And in
order to do so, there have been several mutual cooperation
and joint ventures with leading international companies
where ADNOC has been and will continue to be an ideal
strategic partner.</p>
<p>Over the last few years significant achievements were
made in the expansion and development of gas fields to meet
increased demand from industry gas users and gas injection
requirements in order to enhance the oil and condensate
recovery from the producing fields. ADNOC is committed to
sustainable development.</p>


	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/adnoc-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>ADNOC has subsidiary companies working in the various
fields of the oil, gas, and petrochemical industry as well
as crude oil and gas transport and services. Many of these
companies comprise joint ventures, partnerships and
contractual co-operations with international companies
from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Portugal,
Austria, Germany, Japan, China and more. These subsidiary
companies form the ADNOC Group of Companies comprising ADNOC’s overall activities. In exploration and production of
oil and gas, there come Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil
Operations (ADCO), Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company
(ADMA-OPCO), Zakum Development Company (ZADCO)
and National Drilling Company (NDC). In gas processing,
there come Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Ltd. (GASCO), Abu
Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company Ltd. (ADGAS), Al Hosn Gas
and ADNOC Linde Industrial Gases Company Ltd. (ELIXIER).
Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company (TAKREER) and Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company for Distribution (ADNOC Distribution)
are categorized under refining and distribution of petroleum
products. Under petrochemicals, there come Abu Dhabi
Polymers Company Ltd. (Borouge) and Ruwais Fertilizer
Industries (FERTIL). Petroleum Services Company (ESNAAD)
and Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Operating Company
(IRSHAD) are involved in logistics. And Abu Dhabi National
Tanker Company and National Gas Shipping Company Ltd.
(ADNATCO-NGSCO) are engaged in maritime transportation.</p>

    
    
<P>The UAE crude oil exports are estimated at 2.8 million
barrels per day. But in line with ADNOC’s mission of exploiting
oil and gas reserves in order to secure adequate and reliable
supplies, the company continues to develop its exploration &
production and refining infrastructure with plans to raise Oil
production to 3.5 million barrels per day by the year 2017. In the
Gas sector, Abu Dhabi embarked and successfully overcame
the challenges of developing the first unconventional sour gas
field. The Shah Gas field will start production in 2014 adding to
the overall gas supplies in Abu Dhabi.</P>

    <img src="images/adnoc-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
<p>A closer look at how these subsidiaries operate and work
gives a glimpse of the philosophy behind the company and
its group’s business model. For example, at the downstream
level, ADNOC Distribution has a domestic, regional and
global network of distributors and retail outlets selling oilbased
auto-lubricants and greases that comply with the
most top state-of-the-art international standards and health,
safety and environment preservation measurements. Most
significantly was ADNOC’s exclusive deal with German auto
maker BMW’s dealers for supplying lubricants. Also, Borouge
has established an international network of hubs and offices
to follow up and handle its products of polypropylene and
polyethylene to end clients. Through its fleet of tankers,
NGSCO handles the shipment of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
to clients around the world. The inauguration of the Fujairah
Terminal, which is considered of the three biggest bunkering
ports in the world, on the Gulf of Oman with direct access
to the Indian Ocean, has contributed in diversifying ADNOC
export outlets, rather than doing it all through the Strait of
Hormuz in the Gulf. The port is meant to transport around
1.5 million barrels of crude oil in a pipeline that stretches for
almost 400 km from Habshan to international waters via the
Port of Fujairah.</p>
<p>Being an Abu Dhabi-government owned company,
ADNOC is keen in complying with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi
2030 Vision. Such vision requires companies to balance
between their safeties standards of both human kind and the
environment while posing a responsible business model.</p>
<p>In 2009, the company has launched the ‘ADNOC
Sustainability Performance Initiative’ ensuring a harmonious
balance between human kind, society’s needs, preserving
the Earth’s resources, while posing a responsible business
model. ADNOC is proud that its track record in HSE sets the
standards for the rest of the Arabian Gulf.</p>

   <b>ADNOC BeAAT industry waste treatment facility unique in the region</b>
        
<p>ADNOC launched the most advanced hazardous waste treatment facility in the Middle East. The facility has been
running by ADNOC subsidiary Takreer since operations at the Central Environment Protection Facilities Project
BeAAT, which means environments in Arabic, kicked off in March 2010. The plant treats the widest range of
refinery waste, including liquids, slurries, highly toxic organic compounds and heavy metals. Unlike most other
treatment facilities, the technology can also treat highly flammable and extremely toxic metal organic compounds.</p>
<p>In addition, the facility has the capacity to recycle more than 1,500 metric tons of waste oil each year. Takreer’s
Central Environment Protection Facilities Project has been built near the company’s Ruwais Refinery in the
emirate of Abu Dhabi, and handles the safe treatment and disposal of waste materials produced by ADNOC and
all of the group’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies. BeAAT operates according to the highest standards of the
US Environmental Protection Agency and meets all UAE Federal environmental legislations.</p>

        <p>Since its formation in 1980, FERTIL has been actively
involved in utilizing the lean gas supplied from Abu
Dhabi onshore fields of BAB, Asab and Thammama-C to
manufacture and market fertilizers locally and internationally.
The initial capacity of the factory was 1,000 metric tons per
day (MTPD) of the ammonia and 1,500 MTPD of urea. Within
few years of operation, the capacity has increased to match
the raising demand to reach 1,310 MTPD of ammonia and
1,850 MTPD of urea. In 1988, a hydrogen recovery unit was
added.</p>
<p>Located in Ruwais Industrial Zone, about 235 km to the
west of the capital city of Abu Dhabi, FERTIL caters to the
local needs of ammonia and urea fertilizers, while serving
global demand with an active portfolio of exports. 88 percent
of the company production is exported to countries in Latin
America, USA, Far East, Middle East, Africa and the Indian
Sub-continent.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/fertil-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
<p>In 2007, the company made a significant step in its path
to increase its production capabilities and maintain a better
environmental footprint by signing a USD 240 million deal
with Pakistan’s Descon Engineering and Switzerland’s Urea
Casale. This deal enabled the company to boost its urea
output by 50 percent. In line with the company’s strategy of
reducing the carbon dioxide emissions, the facilities that are
used to increase the production generate lesser amount of
carbon dioxide emissions than prior to the expansion.</p>
<p>In fact, that was the first step in the company’s threeleg
capacity enhancement project, which also included
granulation and CO2 recovery units. As a result, FERTIL’s
urea production jumped to 2500 MTPD by utilizing surplus ammonia produced from the ammonia plant along with the
additional recovered CO2.</p>
<p>However, with the global demand growing enormously, the
company is considering a major upgrade for its manufacturing
plants that will comprise the building of a USD 1.2 billion
fertilizer plant called FERTIL 2. Scheduled to start production in January 2013, the new facility will produce ammonia and
urea, with a production capacity of 2,000 and 3,500 MTPD,
respectively.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/fertil-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Not only will FERTIL 2 increase the company’s exporting
capabilities to target potential markets, it is also expected
to strengthen the company’s position as a major player in
the global petrochemical sector amid a significant shift in
the industrial focus from upstream to mid- and downstream
petrochemicals and energy-based industries that will help
maximize the economic benefits from oil and gas.</p>
<p>The expansion project matches Abu Dhabi’s ambitious
2030 strategic plan to diversify national income resources
and maintain steady growth in major industries. Both FERTIL
1 and FERTIL 2 are designed with sustainability in mind. The
company has been a pioneer in HSE (Health, Safety and
Environment) performance and is highly regarded in corporate
social responsibility. FERTIL’s achievement of 12 million manhours
and 13 years without LTI stands as a shining example of
its total commitment to safety and environmental issues.</p>

   <b>Fertile expansion plans: Gearing up for export</b>
        
<p>Since FERTIL is an export driven company, it was important to enhance
its production operations and expand the manufacturing capacity.
In 2009, FERTIL signed a USD 1.2 billion contract with Samsung
Engineering to construct a fertilizer complex in the Al Ruwais Industrial
Zone, which will be FERTIL’s second factory in the region.</p>
<p>Slated for completion by early 2013, the expansion project, FERTIL-2,
includes the construction of ammonia and urea plants at the company’s
fertilizer complex in Al Ruwais.</p>
<p>FERTIL’s main objective of the project is to increase the fertilizer
complex’s production capacity from 0.65 million tons per year to
2 million tons. The new single stream ammonia plant will have a
capacity of 2,000 metric tons per day and the single stream urea
plant will produce 3,500 metric tons per day of granulated urea. The
capacity of the fertilizer complex will increase to 3,300 metric tons of ammonia and 5,800 of urea by the first quarter of 2013. This will be
further complemented by an optimization of capacity through building
synergies with FERTIL-1. Other significant features of this project
include a 100,000 ton bulk storage capacity and the upgrading of ship
loaders and the conveying system.</p>

        <p>The UAE has a dynamic presence on the global stage,
especially in areas that require transparent collaboration
and sharing of expertise at the highest levels. Energy is
one such industry where the inter-dependence of nations,
alongside proven competencies, is paramount to sustainable
growth and the future of this shared planet. In this challenging
sphere, a young and ambitious entrant is Mubadala Petroleum,
an internationally-oriented upstream oil and gas exploration
and production company headquartered in Abu Dhabi. It
was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala
Development Company in 2012, incorporating and building
on the success of this multi-national conglomerate’s oil and
gas exposure.</p>
<p>Mubadala Petroleum manages assets and operations at all
stages of the upstream value chain located across its focus
markets. The assets it manages include exploration, appraisal,
development and production projects, with a primary
geographic focus on the Middle East, Africa and Central and
Southeast Asia. The company’s success can be attributed to
its strong commercial acumen and the partnership-driven
approach that has been central to its business from the
outset. Its focus is to be the leading Eastern Hemisphere
upstream oil and gas business through people, partnerships
and performance.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
<p>At present, Mubadala Petroleum is an active participant in
a number of major projects including the world-class Dolphin
Energy project, which is central to meeting the energy needs
of the UAE; enhanced oil recovery projects in Oman and
Bahrain; and high impact exploration in Kazakhstan, Tanzania
and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The company’s inception can be traced back to the year
2002, when Dolphin Energy was incorporated with Mubadala
as a 51% shareholder. This newly formed entity soon shared its expertise in the region and beyond with the starting of
oil production from the Jasmine oil field in Thailand and a
production sharing contract in Oman in the year 2005. In the
next few years, it also reaped commendable successes in
Qatar, Bahrain, Indonesia and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Focusing on the many opportunities that the Caspian
Sea region holds, the company ventured into Kazakhstan
in June 2009 through a partnership for the exploration of
the Nursultan Block (N Block). Proving the timeliness of this
expansion, the first exploration well in the area encountered
hydrocarbons at several levels in the year 2010. Mubadala
Petroleum’s success has been an extraordinary story, right
from its beginnings as the catalyst for the Dolphin project
through to the incorporation of Pearl Energy into the
organisation and presently as a fully-fledged exploration and
production business.</p>
<p>The company’s places equal emphasis on the unceasing
improvement of health, safety, security and environmental
(HSSE) performance. Proving this aim are its excellent trackrecords

   <b>Continued a long-standing success in Thailand</b>
        
<p>Lasting partnerships built with host governments, national and international oil and gas companies and the
communities in which it operates are central to Mubadala Petroleum’s success. The accomplishments by the
company throughout its enduring presence in Thailand demonstrate this as well as its wide-reaching capabilities.</p>
<p>Mubadala Petroleum has had a presence in the region through Pearl Oil since 2004 and is currently the country’s
third largest petroleum concessionaire. It operates 12 concessions in this highly-lucrative market, including the
very successful Jasmine B5/27 offshore developments in the Gulf of Thailand. Along the way, it also became
the first company in Thailand to be awarded two major international accreditations: ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.</p>
<p>Its growth can be traced back to a key success in 2005, when just 13 months after concession acquisition, the
first Jasmine platform, WPA, was installed and first oil was produced. Today, six platforms and one Floating
Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit are in operation. Ban Yen produced first oil in 2008 and the
production milestone of 40 million barrels was reached in December 2011. As of 2011, production output stood at
a commendable 17,500 bopd and all production used locally to meet Thailand’s growing energy needs. The Gulf
of Thailand continues to be its core area with present interests spanning eight licenses.</p>
<p>Mubadala Petroleum’s contribution to the Thai economy since commencing operations has been truly significant,
with total expenditures up to the end of 2011 in excess of USD 1.5 billion, and taxes and royalty payments of more
than USD 750 million.</p>

   <b>Gemasolar – a revolution in the CSP sector</b>
        
<p>In October 2011, Torresol Energy, a joint venture between Masdar
and SENER – the leading Spanish engineering and construction
firm, held the official inauguration ceremony of the 19.9MW
concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, Gemasolar.</p>
<p>Gemasolar is the first commercial plant in the world to use
molten salt thermal storage in a central tower configuration
with a heliostat field - an efficient system that improves the
dispatchability of electric power from renewable sources.</p>
<p>By operating for a total of 6,450 hours a year at full capacity and
producing a net total of over 110 GWhe per year, Gemasolar can
supply electricity to a population of 27,500 households in the
South of Spain.</p>
<p>This annual production of Gemasolar (110GWhe) is the equivalent
of the energy generated in a conventional thermal plant burning
89,000 tons of lignite or the converted energy of 217,000 oil
barrels. Therefore, the plant is expected to save more than
30,000 tonnes of CO2 emission a year.</p>
<p>Torresol Energy also recently announced commissioning of the
Valle 1 and Valle 2 plants - two identical 50 MW parabolic trough
plants, located in Cádiz, in the South of Spain.</p>

        <p>For a nation that started its journey towards economic
prosperity with the discovery of oil, the UAE has
come a long way by diversifying into different sectors,
while contributing to the progress of the energy industry
globally. Since the early-1980s, Abu Dhabi, as the capital
of the UAE, has been a key player on the global investment
stage, spreading its success internationally. The company
mandated with all its foreign investments in the oil and
chemical sector is the International Petroleum Investment
Company PJSC (IPIC), a wholly-owned enterprise of the
Government of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>IPIC, was formed in 1984 and tasked with making
investments in the energy sector by following a prudent
strategy and enabling inclusive growth. The company has
been investing, on a long-term basis, in overseas energy and
energy-related assets and initiating strategic projects within
the UAE. Today, IPIC has stakes in more than 15 companies
and an invested presence across 10 countries on all five
continents.</p>

    <img src="images/ipic-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
<p>As of 30 June 2012, the company had 100% ownership
or control over five significant operating companies either
directly or through its special purpose vehicles. These are
Borealis AG, based in Austria; Aabar, based in UAE; Falcon
Private Bank, based in Switzerland; Nova Chemicals
Corporation, based in Canada; and Compañía Española de
Petróleos SA (CEPSA), based in Spain. Furthermore, the
group has minority stakes in significant operating companies
such as OMV AG, based in Austria as well as other joint
ventures in the UAE. Additionally, the company’s subsidiary, Aabar Investments PJSC (Aabar), undertakes other investing
activities in various growth industries.</p>
<p>Some of the company’s significant milestones when it
started out on the international stage were the initial stake
of 9.5% in Cepsa in 1988; a 13% stake in OMV, which was
subsequently increased to 24.9%; and an investment in
Borealis of 25%, which was increased to 64% in 2005. IPIC
also has a stake in the Pakistan based Pak-Arab Refinery
Ltd. (Parco) through the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Investment
Company, of which it owns 40% of the total shares.</p>
<p>IPIC can be judged by the quality of its network of
global partners who all share its vision of the world and
the values of integrity and trust. It has also been entrusted
by the Government of Abu Dhabi to fulfil the role of a core
shareholder in Chemaweyaat, an entity which will transform the Petrochemicals sector of emirate’s domestic economy.</p>

    <img src="images/ipic-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>During April 2009, IPIC was assigned long term credit
ratings of Aa2/AA/AA with a stable outlook, by Fitch Ratings
and Standard and Poor’s respectively and as of March 2010,
it was assigned a rating of Aa3 with a stable outlook by
Moody’s. In addition to the continuous support from the
Government of Abu Dhabi, IPIC’s ratings are a reflection of
the quality and strength of its portfolio of assets, underlying
cash flows and profit-making.</p>
<p>In less than three decades, IPIC has acquired extensive
insights into the hydrocarbon industry, and the fundamentals
of investing and portfolio management. It has managed
commendable successes across the hydrocarbon value chain
with a portfolio that continues to grow in terms of value as
well as significance.</p>

   <b>An energetic presence in Spain</b>
        
<p>IPIC acquired a stake in CEPSA, an integrated energy company
operating at every stage of the oil value chain, in 1988. Since
then, IPIC maintained close links and worked in cooperation for
the company’s advancement. By continuing to grow its stake
over the years, during August 2011, IPIC acquired the company
by recognising its potential and became the single shareholder
in CEPSA.</p>
<p>By having IPIC as its sole shareholder, CEPSA is presented with
a magnificent opportunity for growth as well as the backing to
overcome business challenges. Continuing its trend of financial
success, CEPSA posted Clean CCS EBITDA of USD 818.3 million
during the first half of 2012, 9% higher from the year before.</p>
<p>Today, CEPSA is Spain’s fourth largest industrial group in
terms of turnover, employs more than 12,000 employees and
continues to uphold its legacy of more than 80 years. Through
progressive internationalisation of its activities, it also has
business interests in Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Panama,
Peru and Portugal and sells its products all over the world.
CEPSA is company that showcases IPIC’s inimitable investment
approach and matches its prudent ambitions.</p>

        <p>The initial driver behind the establishment of Dolphin
Energy in 1999 was to implement the Dolphin Gas
Project. It is the first cross-border refined gas transmission
project and the largest energy-related venture ever
undertaken in the GCC region. A Development and
Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) was reached in 2001
between the governments of the UAE and Qatar to allow the
Abu Dhabi Government and its partners in Dolphin Energy
to invest in the appraisal, drilling and construction of the
upstream facilities in a dedicated concession area in the
North Field.</p>
<p>In return, Dolphin Energy would share with Qatar the
income from the valuable by-products extracted at its Ras
Laffan Gas Processing Plant, while buying all the natural gas
for export to the UAE and Oman.</p>

    <img src="images/dolphin-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Since 2007, Dolphin Energy has been producing
substantial quantities of raw natural gas from the 24 deep
wells drilled in Qatar’s offshore North Field. This gas is then
sent onshore to Dolphin Energy’s Gas Processing Plant
in Qatar’s Ras Laffan Industrial City where valuable byproducts
are extracted for international sale. One done, the
processed methane gas is transported through the 364 km,
48-inch subsea export pipeline all the way to the company’s
receiving facilities at Taweelah in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Around two billion standard cubic feet of gas per day (bscf/
day) is now being delivered through the export pipeline to
Dolphin Energy’s customers throughout the UAE and Oman.
With support from the governments of the UAE, Qatar and Oman, Dolphin Energy is in an excellent position to ensure
this delivery for the next 25 years.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/dolphin-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->

<p>By applying its high values and principles of fiscal
responsibility, integrity, respect, social responsibility and
teamwork, Dolphin Energy aims to become a leading and
reliable supplier of clean energy.</p>
<p>Today, Dolphin Energy meets 30 percent of the UAE’s
energy requirements and its natural gas is helping to support
the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 by being a reliable supplier of
clean energy. The company also acts as a bridge between
the traditional uses of energy and a future when renewable
sources of energy will be used extensively.</p>

   <b>Dolphin Energy: bringing three nations together</b>
        
<p>Dolphin Energy is a strategic energy initiative, bringing
three GCC countries together in an international gas
network for the very first time. One significant challenge
was how to deal with unique and complex matters
relating to sovereignty, gas field extents, production and
marketing issues, all of which had to be settled through
discussions, often where there was no legal precedent.
However, because of high levels of co operation and
mutual trust and respect, Dolphin Energy succeeded.</p>
<p>Dolphin Energy did not just overcame obstacles to
bring three nations together and today has grown into a
successful operating company able to meet and exceed
long term commitments, set industry standards and
achieve excellence.</p>
<p>With the support from the governments of the UAE, Qatar
and Oman, Dolphin Energy foster the development of
long-term new industries throughout the region to create
sustainable wealth, economic prosperity and employment
opportunities for the citizens of the region far into the
future.</p>

        <p>Over the course of four decades, the United Arab
Emirates has successfully shaped a liberal and
increasingly diversified economy. It’s relatively low border
barriers to trade and highly evolved policy framework
make it an important supporter of the global multilateral
trading system. The effects of operating in this business
environment is equally visible in the oil and gas sector, which
has seen many UAE-based companies establish a formidable
footprint globally, while playing a key role in the nation’s
economic diversification. An admirable example of this is
ENOC, which has not just partnered with companies globally,
but also embraced and promoted new technologies locally.</p>
<p>Established in 1993 as a wholly-owned company of the
Government of Dubai, ENOC aims to promote the interests
of its shareholder through the development of further
downstream and upstream activities in the oil and gas
sector and beyond. The group’s first subsidiary commenced
operations way back in 1973 with the implicit aim to
encourage the economic diversification of Dubai and the
rest of the UAE. The group also includes Cylingas Company,
the first LPG cylinder factory in the GCC, which became fully
operational in 1976. The ENOC refinery, first in Dubai, was
completed in 1999 and in the year 2011 started running at its
full capacity of 120,000 bpd throughout the year.</p>

    <img src="images/enoc-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
<p>In 1999, ENOC acquired majority stake in Dragon Oil
PLC, with its principal producing asset in Caspian Sea,
offshore Turkmenistan, which set in motion its international
expansion plans. Drawing on the growth of the UAE as a
strategic hub for global trade and aimed at meeting the
fast-growing demand for bulk liquid terminalling, ENOC
created Horizon Terminals Limited (Horizon) in the year
2003. Operating from the UAE as a holding company,
Horizon consolidated the company’s existing terminalling
investments and expanded the business globally. Since its
incorporation, Horizon has expanded from its terminals in
UAE and Saudi Arabia as of 2003, to now cover Singapore,
South Korea, Djibouti and Morocco. Closer to home, it also
operates a joint venture with Chevron, EPPCO International
Limited (EIL), which caters to domestic fuels from its base
in Jebel Ali.</p>

<p>ENOC also operates a network of over 115 service
stations in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. In addition to
its core fuel retailing under the ENOC/EPPCO brands, the
service stations feature ZOOM, which is also the exclusive
convenience store operator in the Dubai Metro. ENOC Retail
at present serves more than 70 million customers annually
and franchises several F&B brands across the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA).</p>
<p> At the core of ENOC’s operations is the supply, trading
and processing (STP) segment that lends impetus to the
organisation’s growth by maximising returns on midstream
and downstream assets. Further to this, its marketing
segment caters to the requirements of commercial supplies
in domestic and international markets and is a major player
in the domestic aviation fuel marketing.</p>

<p>Responsible, reliable, innovative and progressive, ENOC
positions itself as the ‘Energy Partner of Choice’. It has
attracted an experienced team of industry leaders who understand
the market place, customers, competition, risks,
opportunities and what it takes to successfully steer an oil
and gas group. Its business structure is designed to facilitate
product and service delivery in terms of individual groups
of product lines. Through this approach, the company
successfully overcame the challenges of the global economic
slowdown by expanding strategically and posted annual
revenues of USD 13,311 billion in the year 2011 as compared
to USD 10,211 billion in the year 2010.</p>
<p>Central within its vision to be the leading regional integrated
oil and gas group is an aim to be socially-responsible towards
employees, community and environment. ENOC has over
the years spearheaded several unique initiatives with its
most recent one being the opening of the Middle East’s first
‘green’ service station. Its foresighted approach has brought

   <b>Smooth-sailing in Singapore</b>
        
<p>ENOC’s expansion over the years has been
driven by attributes of proactively identifying
problems, seizing new growth opportunities,
taking calculated risks and achieving
business excellence. In the year 1999, ENOC
established a formidable international
presence by starting its trading operations in
Singapore, becoming the first Middle Eastern
oil company to do so.</p>
<p>Horizon Singapore Terminals Private Limited
(HSTPL) is situated on Jurong Island, the
petrochemical hub of Singapore and the
world’s top bunkering port by volume. The
strategic location of the terminal on the southwestern
quadrant of Singapore provides for
smooth marine traffic movements for tankers.
Horizon Singapore Terminals Private Limited
is also an integral component of the global
pricing mechanism for crude and refined
petroleum products in the region.</p>
<p>ENOC Singapore has grown from strength
to strength and has made rapid strides and
achieved recognition as a Global Trader
under the Global Trader Program (GTP) from
the International Enterprise Singapore and
was included among the top ‘Singapore 1000
company’ for the last five years.</p>

        <p>Dragon Oil was incorporated in Ireland in 1971 and
moved headquarters to Dubai, UAE in 1998. Since
then it has become an independent international oil and
gas exploration, development and production company.
Emirates National Oil Company Limited (ENOC), a company
of the Government of Dubai, owns approximately 54% of the
company’s ordinary share capital. Dragon Oil is registered in
Ireland with a primary listing on the Irish Stock Exchange and,
since 6 April 2010, in accordance with recent changes to the
UK listing Regime, has been designated as a ‘premium listing’
on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Dragon Oil has been evaluating targets that fit its criteria
within Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East and selectively
south-east Asia in order to create a diversified balanced
portfolio of exploration and development assets for the
Group.</p>
<p>The company was established to be international since
day one. In 1999, a Production Sharing Agreement was
signed with the Government of Turkmenistan to re-develop
oil and gas resources in the Cheleken Contract Area for a
term of 25 years from 1st of May 2000 and an exclusive right
to negotiate an extension of not less than 10 years. Thus,
Dragon Oil Turkmenistan was established as the operator
and granted a production license for that purpose. The
Cheleken Contract Area, in the eastern section of the Caspian
Sea, offshore Turkmenistan is the principal producing asset
of Dragon Oil.</p>

<p>Dragon Oil has been working in Turkmenistan for more
than 12 years. More than USD 2.5 billion has been invested
in expanding the oil production in the Cheleken Contract
Area, making Dragon Oil one of the largest foreign investorsin Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>The Group is producing from a significant number of new
and old wells and has an aggressive development program
comprising the drilling of new wells and an ongoing workover
program. The average daily gross field production has
increased from approximately 7,000 barrels of oil per day
(bopd) in 2000 to over 67,600 bopd of average daily gross
production in 2012 with the 2012 December average gross
production of 73,500 bopd.</p> 
<p>As of 31st December 2012, Dragon Oil had proven,
probable oil and condensate reserves of 677 million barrels
and 59 million of oil and condensate contingent resources,
1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves (corresponding to 250
million barrels of oil equivalent) and 1.4 trillion cubic feet of
gas resources.</p>
<p>As part of its expansion strategy, in October 2011, Dragon
Oil signed a farm-in agreement with a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cooper Energy Limited for a 55% participating
interest in the Bargou Exploration Permit, offshore Tunisia.
The Permit is located in the Gulf of Hammamet in the
Mediterranean Sea and covers an area of 4,616 square
kilometers with predominantly offshore exploration
prospects.</p>

    <img src="images/dragon-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>In 2012, in a consortium of companies Dragon Oil was
awarded an exploration, development and production
contract (EDPSC) for Block 9 in Iraq’s fourth bidding round.
Block 9 is located in the Basra province. In January 2013,
the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and the Tender Committee signed
the final service contract for the block with the consortium
(Kuwait Energy at 70% and operator and Dragon Oil at 30%);
this marks the commencement of exploration activities by
the consortium in Block 9.</p>
<p>In November 2012, a consortium of companies comprising
Dragon Oil, Kuwait Energy, Turkiye Petrolleri A.O. (TPAO)
and the Ghazanfar Group, submitted a bid for two blocks
and later, in December 2012, was selected as the winning
bidder for two blocks, Sanduqli and Mzar-i-Sharif, of the
Afghan-Tajik Phase 1 Oil and Gas Tender. The consortium has
been invited to enter into negotiations with the Afghanistan
Ministry of Mines for the exploration, development and
production activities in the two blocks, which are expected
to take place and conclude in first quarter of 2013.</p>
<p>Dragon Oil has been looking for opportunities in countries
with significant hydrocarbon resource in its regions of
interest that represent potentially attractive diversification
opportunities for the Group.</p>
