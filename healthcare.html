        <p>Healthcare is the very foundation for the flourishing of a
nation and its exports enable inclusive growth globally.
In turn, a quality-driven, innovative pharmaceutical sector
makes the world safer for its citizens and safeguards the
future for everyone. Flying the UAE’s flag high in this field is
Julphar (Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries), a Ras Al Khaimahheadquartered
leader in the production and distribution of
pharmaceutical products across five continents.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1980, Julphar has been committed
to meeting the needs of an evolving society and playing
an instrumental role in global healthcare development. Its
approach to a fast-paced market is to focus on strategic
initiatives, quality product development and responsible
practices.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the UAE’s policy of caring for
the people beyond its borders, Julphar’s goal is to create
innovative and high-quality products, whilst maintaining a
competitive cost. It is a true reflection of Ras al Khaimah’s
significant development and continues to lead as one of the
UAE’s most influential local businesses making an impact on
the global stage.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/julphar-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>The two-pronged approach that the company has been
built on comprises world-class manufacturing facilities based
in the UAE and beyond, and a reliable distribution network.
Julphar contains a diverse portfolio of products which targets
a wide range of major therapeutic segments.</p>
<p>The company’s mission is to deliver excellence in
healthcare which will enable its customers to live a long and
healthy life. It is through this aim that it has emerged as one
of the largest distributors of pharmaceutical products in the
MENA region within just over three decades.</p> 
<p>Julphar currently has over 3,500 registered products across
the world that is distributes through its reliable logistics
network to clients in over 40 countries globally. The segments
in this diverse product portfolio include endocrinology, antiinfective,
cardiovascular and gastroenterology, over-thecounter,
nephrology, dermatology, respiratory, metabolic,
and burn and wound management. Further on, highlighting its commitment to diabetes management in the region,
it also became the only company in the MRNA region to
produce the raw material needed to make insulin through its
dedicated division.</p>
<p>Julphar’s eleven local world-class manufacturing facilities
are located in Ras Al Khaimah and it expanded this regionally with the launch of its first overseas manufacturing facility in
Ethiopia during 2013. It also endeavours to take this ambition
further with additional facilities in strategic countries such as
Saudi Arabia and Algeria. Some of the key trusted products
in the Julphar Consumer Health line-up are Adol®, Profinal®,
Calvitalis®, Ginsavit® and Amydramine®.</p>
<p> The launch of both local and global facilities, teamed with
an emphasis on difficult markets has taken the forefront
of its overall strategy. This has evidently paid-off, with its
biotechnology sector showing excellent performance.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/julphar-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>The company’s other subsidiaries include Menacool; a
transportation division which maintains a fleet of vehicles
for efficient distribution of products, thus enabling it to
react quickly to market demand and Planet Pharmacies;
a joint venture with Global Investment House which was
established in 2007 and grew from the acquisition of
independent pharmacy businesses located across the United
Arab Emirates, Oman and Saudi Arabia. Planet Pharmacy
has region-wide exclusive agency agreements with major
international brands and currently has more than 100 retail
pharmacies as well as a wholesale distribution division.</p>
<p>Julphar’s promise is to continually develop products,
people and services by achieving and maintaining the
highest international standards in treatment, education,
and community outreach. In terms of commendations,  
Julphar has twice won the prestigious Mohammed Bin
Rashid Al Maktoum Business Award, as well as the 2011 Arab
Achievement Award.</p>
<p>The Julphar Quality Management System (QMS) enables
it to integrate quality into all stages of manufacturing. Its
objective is to incorporate continuous Good Manufacturing
Practices (cGMP). Its facilities and QMS are accredited by
ISO: 9001:2000 and ISO 14001. Julphar is also approved
by international authorities such as UNICEF, JFDA, SFDA,
German and Romanian authority.</p>
<p>A major factor in its success to date has been the ability
to both cultivate talent from inside the organisation and
recruit new talent to ensure that the right people do the
right jobs. For this purpose, it established a standardised
corporate process to identify and recruit personnel most
suited to the company’s current and future needs in a fair,
objective and non-discriminative manner. Currently, over
2,800 professionals worldwide are working together to bring
Julphar’s ambitions and goals to fruition.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/julphar-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <P> The organisation’s solid balance sheet, low-gearing and
continued focus on operating cash flow generation gives
it the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including strategic acquisitions that supplement strong
organic growth. The end of 2011 marked a major milestone
for the company, when sales figures exceeded AED 1 billion
for the first time – a testament to the high-quality processes
and growing demand of its products.</P>
<p>Taking it further, Julphar closed the year 2012 at AED1.18
billion, producing overall steady results, with a year-onyear
growth of 15.3% over sales from 2011. By adhering to
a prudent expansion approach and constantly striving for
excellence, Julphar is today not just well positioned to meet
tomorrow’s healthcare challenges, but is also shaping the
future of this industry.</P>

   <b>Enabling accessible cure in Ethiopia</b>
        
<p>From the outset, Africa has been an important market
for Julphar. In recognition of the economic importance
of this continent and the need for increasingly
sophisticated pharmaceutical and healthcare facilities,
Julphar, in conjunction with its local Ethiopian partner,
Medtech, officially inaugurated its first manufacturing
facility in Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in early-2013.</p>
<p> Julphar had first begun providing medicines in
Ethiopia in 2005, significantly growing to cover major
hospitals, clinics and retail pharmacies. The Julphar
Ethiopia plant took this success further by providing
access to high-quality medicine closer to home.</p>
<p>This 40,000 sq ft facility, designed and built by
Julphar’s engineering and construction division, is
cGMP compliant, and once fully operational, the
Julphar plant will produce 25 million bottles of
suspension and syrup, 500 million tablets and 200
million capsules per annum. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology, it enables production of Julphar products not only for the local market but also across for the
African continent.</p>
<p>Julphar has invested over USD 9 million in the construction of the plant and this strategically important launch
took the company closer to bringing more accessible, reliable medicines in the region. It is the first step for Julphar
in opening many more similar plants across the region to create a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry that is
on par with the best in the world.</p>

   <b>Fighting diabetes with ambitious manufacturing</b>
        
<p>In 2008, Julphar made an important strategic decision to become one of the Middle East’s leaders in offering
a world-class treatment for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. With an eye on this mission, it launched Julphar
Diabetes, which today is the only regional company to offer a comprehensive portfolio of high-quality, affordable
drugs that doctors and patients continue to endorse.</p>
<p>Progressing at a fast pace, in 2011, Julphar signed a partnership with International Diabetes Federation (IDF),
ensuring IDF has a key partner in the Middle East region in the fight against diabetes. This also ensured that it
could play a key role in the efforts to promote better diabetes care, management and education, to cut down
diabetes rates in the MENA region, which are amongst the highest in the world.</p>
<p>In 2012, it became the only company in the MENA region to locally produce recombinant human insulin
products, through the completion of its USD 136.1 million dedicated insulin production facility. Julphar Diabetes,
which manages the manufacturing and commercialisation of the company’s diabetes products, has the facility
capabilities to produce approximately 40 million vials of insulin per year. This makes Julphar the fifth largest
producer of insulin in the world, and the only one in the MENA region.</p>
<p>Julphar also has plans to expand the insulin production plant to widen its product offerings and strengthen
its market presence in diabetic care. Since diabetes afflicts sizeable sections of the Middle Eastern population,
Julphar’s venture into bulk insulin production proved to be quite timely. Julphar’s first insulin production began
eight years ago when insulin crystals were imported from European sources for the local production of Jusline®.
It turned this around by producing the crystals in-house, thereby all set to make insulin more available and more
affordable.</p>
<p>Today, Jusline® the Julphar brand for recombinant human Insulin, is primed be a major step towards diabetes care

        <p>Localised pharmaceutical research and manufacturing
can play a crucial role in providing accessible and
affordable medical care for every nation and region. The
United Arab Emirates, as part of its economic diversification
has not just focused on creating world-class healthcare
facilities, but also ensuring support for the pharmaceutical
sector.<p>
<p>Encouraged by the nation’s policy of creating optical
opportunities in every field, Neopharma was set up in the
year 2003 with the first manufacturing facilities planned
on an investment outlay of over US$ 25 million. Today, this
company is the pride of Abu Dhabi, hosting a world- class
pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and a wide ranging
product line.</p>
<p>Within just a few years of successful accomplishment of
registration of the products in the UAE Ministry of Health,
Neopharma set about on an unprecedented growth path
and accomplished several milestones. Its manufacturing
facility in Abu Dhabi is built on the concept of modular
manufacturing, follows global benchmarks in manufacturing
technology and has efficient control mechanisms in place,
ensuring every product is manufactured with the highest
quality standards.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Following the successful presence in the UAE market,
Neopharma expanded its coverage to the GCC countries,
Middle East, Asia, CIS markets, South America and African
Countries. The company’s consistent efforts of maintaining
and building the brand equity and quality over the years
has resulted in appreciation of its standards across various
international markets.</p> 
<p>The organisation believes in positing itself as a globally
admired and technologically-driven enterprise that delivers
the best healthcare possible in the region and beyond. Its
approach can be exemplified by the fact Neopharma was one
of the first companies to capitalise the business opportunities
and take the challenge of re-establishing operations in Libya
in the recent past. It set up a dedicated Scientific Office with
a team consisting of managerial and medical professionals
who rebuilt Neopharma’s operations by promoting more
than 35 pharmaceutical products, a move that was highly
appreciated by both the medical fraternity and the local
population.</p>
<p>In harmony with the motto of the Company “Local
Inspiration and Global Aspiration”, Neopharma further
explored the West African markets and initiated operations
in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Neopharma’s recent
expansion projects include the establishment of a dedicated
Cephalosporin manufacturing facility and an exclusive
research & development centre which will be a pivotal hub for
large research projects and interdisciplinary collaborations
with leading international nanotechnology, biological and
pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>
<p>Following a well-planned growth path, the company
continues to blend innovation and quality to provide worldclass
pharmaceuticals. Forming alliances consistently to benefit the region, Neopharma also partnered with Merck
Serono, a division of Merck KGaA - Germany, in the year 2012,
to locally-produce Merck branded medication in the UAE for
distribution across the Middle East.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->

<p>As a part of community responsibility Neopharma has
also paid great importance to protect the environment. It
has received various accolades for being an environmentallyfriendly
manufacturer and is the recipient of the GCC
Environment Award for being the best institution committed
to Industrial and Environmental Standards and the
Environmental Performance certificate from Ministry of
Environment and Water, UAE for outstanding efforts in
environmental conservation and application of cleaner
production techniques.</p>
<p>Recognising its achievements, Neopharma was awarded
the prestigious Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award in
the manufacturing category and is also the recipient of the
current European Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines
Certification from Belgium.</p>
<p>At present, as Abu Dhabi’s premier generic pharmaceutical
manufacturing facility, Neopharma is in its 10th year of
successful and fruitful accomplishment. It has a presence
across 20 international markets and is working towards
initiating operations in many more key markets.</p>

   <b>Creating greater local access in healthcare</b>
        
<p>Neopharma has been consistently taking steps towards making the region self-reliant for supply of essential
pharmaceutical products. The epitome of its success has been the signing of a manufacturing agreement with the
leading German manufacturer Merck Serono in the year 2012. This partnership involved manufacturing Merck’s
branded medications at Neopharma’s facility for distribution across UAE and the rest of the Middle East markets.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which was the first partnership of its kind, Merck Serono became the first multinational
pharmaceutical company to work with a local manufacturer to cater to regional demand for key pharmaceutical
products through export out of the UAE manufacturing base. Initially, two Merck Serono products are set to be
manufactured by Neopharma: Euthyrox, a hormone therapy requiring a very stringent sterile environment for
production and packaging; and Glucophage, a standard oral treatment for type 2 diabetics.</p>
<p>The company aims to start the production of both branded medications in 2013. With this partnership, Neopharma
has ensured that the lead time for product-to-market reduces significantly along with increased availability of
major treatments for the UAE and the wider region.</p>

<p>GlobalPharma started out with a clear business model,
having three key areas of operation, including manufacturing
and marketing its own brands, manufacturing and marketing
the products of multinational pharmaceutical companies
through ‘in-licensing’, and contract manufacturing products
for other companies. Its core business of manufacturing
its own brands constitutes more than 90 per cent of total sales turnover, thereby making it a self-reliant entity.
Whereas, its in-licensing portfolio comprises products from
leading international names such as Polichem, Switzerland,
Bouchara Recordati, France; and Marco Antonetto, Italy.</p>
<p>Its flagship products include Gloclav (Amoxycillin and
Clavulanate / Antibiotic), Emifenac 50 DT (Diclifenac / NSAID),
Glovit (Multivitamin), Emicipro (Ciprofloxacin / Antibiotic),
Emimycin (Clarithromycin / Antibiotic), Emilok (Omerprazole
/ Anti-ulcerant) and Glodip (Amlodipine / Antihyperstensive).
As part of its contract manufacturing business, it also extends
its manufacturing facilities primarily for Penicillin products
to various companies in the region. Currently, GlobalPharma
is in the final stages of a deal with one of the top-ranking
multinational Pharmaceutical companies to manufacture
their products range for GCC and other Middle Eastern
countries. </p> 
<p>GlobalPharma’s modern pharmaceutical manufacturing
plant occupies 27,000 square metres in Dubai Investment
Park. It manufactures a diverse rangeof over 60 products that include Anti-infectives, Analgesic / Anti-inflammatory,
Gastrointestinal, Nutraceuticals, Gynaecological, Antidiabetics,
Cardio-vascular and Respiratory.</p>

<p> The factory has two separate manufacturing units, for
Penicillin and Non-Penicillin products, with the utilities
in a separate block. Its capabilities extend to a wide range
of dosage forms including tablets, capsules, dry powder
suspensions and oral liquids. The facility is designed to meet
international standards of cGMP, including GCC Ministries
of Health, US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and
UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA). The company ensures zero deficiencies in the final
product through strict adherence to the highest quality
standards across every process.</p>
<p>The annual capacity of the plant is 300 million tablets,
150 million capsules, and over 7 million litres of dry syrup
and liquid, based on one shift of eight hours. Upgraded
consistently, it is well-equipped to take the company through
to the next generation of products.</p>

   <b>Making inroads into the Asian market, and beyond</b>
        
<p>When GlobalPharma planned to expand beyond its immediate regional markets, Asia presented a promising
gateway to large markets. However, the presence of major international as well as home-grown players poised a
unique challenge for a relatively new entrant in the sector. But GlobalPharma, through its focus on innovation and
advancement in every aspect, was already well placed to compete with the best. In order to make inroads into this
continent, the company laid out the strategy to enter nations where the pharmaceutical sector was in the initial
stages of expansion and emerging fast.</p>
<p>By applying its pioneering manufacturing business model formed in the UAE and other Middle Eastern markets,
GlobalPharma forayed into countries like the Philippines and Cambodia, which was soon extended to Sri Lanka
and Afghanistan, with plans to extend further in the Caspian region. What’s more, GlobalPharma has future
ambitious plans of exploring viable opportunities in the highly lucrative European and North American markets.</p>
<p>GlobalPharma is also eager to further expand its products portfolio in the fast growing disease areas like Obesity,
Cardio-vascular and Diabetes and will soon enter new therapeutic areas like Oncology, Hormone Therapies and
Parenteral products.</p>
