        <p>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies are guided by the objectives
and principles to provide help and assistance to the most
vulnerable groups without discrimination as to nationality,
race, colour, religious beliefs, political and intellectual
affiliations. The UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA), as
the only entity in the country representing the societies,
is based on the same underlying rules laid down in
international conventions. It is the nation’s main relief and
aid agency, which is independent, but takes a lead role in the
government’s humanitarian activities.</p>
<p>The UAE RCA was founded in 1983, and became the 139th
member of the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies in 1986. Outside the UAE, the agency
responds to emergency situations, as well as undertaking
health programmes and humanitarian projects. It also
undertakes continuous medical care initiatives within the
Emirates to help the underprivileged.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Some of the key aid programmes that it has been involved
in include the mission to help those affected by the Haiti
earthquake, medical surgeries in Somalia, delivery of relief
supplies to Sichuan province in China in the aftermath of a
devastating earthquake and supply of essential medical and
food to Myanmar within three days of Cyclone Nargis.</p>
<p>It is also actively involved in reconstruction projects, the
most prominent among these being the Skeikh Zayed City in Kabul. Sheikh Zayed City, a project that built 200 homes on a
60 acre area in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The cost of
phase I of the development was USD 4.5 million, while phase
II, is currently in progress, involves building the infrastructure
for the city at a cost of USD 2 million, and includes roads,
sewerage, water and electricity supplies. Recently, the UAE
RCA also started construction on the Mazraq-2 compound
for those displaced by conflict in northern Yemen. These
compounds can house over 7,000 displaced and consist of
1,000 tents, providing food, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>In the UAE, the authority as part of its regular initiatives
provided USD 354.000 in medical assistance to needy people
of limited income. It was disbursed to 148 beneficiaries in
Abu Dhabi, Bani Yas and the Western Region to cover costs
of surgical operations overseas, medicine, wheelchairs and
prosthetic hearing aid and devices for hearing impaired
people whose cases are not covered by medical insurance.</p>

<p>Amongst the key areas of focus that the UAE RCA is involved overseas are social infrastructure and services, water
supply and sanitation, health and education. In the year 2009,
the UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) gave a total of USD
122.9 million, making it the third most significant donor from
the nation in financial terms. Around 76 percent of these
funds were spent in Asia, most notably the Middle East which
received 58 percent, while sub-Saharan Africa received nearly
18 percent of total funds. At least 55 countries received
funding from the agency in support of a number of sectors,
with the largest contributions going to social infrastructure
and services and multi-sector programs.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Till date, the UAE RCA has supported projects in more
than 100 countries, and occupies a significant place in the
UAE non-profit sector. It continues to be one of the first aid
agencies on ground in times of unforeseen crises. Through
its experienced team, the agency also is actively involved
in helping economies of developing countries and nations
marred by conflict.</p>

   <b>Flying in aid to Haiti</b>
        
<p>The devastating Haiti earthquake on 12 January 2010
claimed over 200,000 lives and displaced over 1.5
million people. The UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA)
immediately responded to the humanitarian call for
help initiated by the International Red Cross and Red
Crescent. It started implementing various programmes
to support those in need with the first phase of the
programme providing supplies and aid worth over
USD 136.000, making it a principle contributor to this
cause.</p>
<p>The second phase, valued at over USD 245.000,
included sending a cargo plane with about 45 tonnes
of food and essential material to Haiti. Additionally, the UAE RCA flew in about 100 tonnes of foods and support products through the Dominican Republic. It also
continues support on ground through medical delegations and healthcare camps. As an agency dedicated to
serving humanitarian causes worldwide, its timely initiatives in Haiti not just bough relief to those affected by the
calamity, but also helped in rebuilding the nation.

        <p>As a nation that believes in growth and prosperity
for everyone, UAE and organizations from the
nation have been major contributors to alleviating global
poverty. One of the major names in this field is the Abu
Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), which was founded
in the nation’s inception year of 1971 with the vision to be a
model institution in providing development assistance that
alleviates global poverty. The fund helps developing countries
achieve sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty
by providing financial resources, forging partnerships in the
public and private sectors, and adopting international best
practices to ensure aid effectiveness.</p>
<p>ADFD is an autonomous institution owned by the Abu Dhabi
Government and to date, it has provided extensive financial
facilities for building and launching vital developmental
projects in various sectors across the world. The fund’s
activities since inception include interests in land investment,
agriculture, livestock & fisheries, water & electricity, housing,
transportation & storage, industry & mining, social & health
services, tourism & hotels, telecommunications and studies &

<p>ADFD also contributes to commercial projects that are
inclined towards development with the aim to provide jobs
and stability in local communities of developing countries.
It has carefully chosen a wide range of sectors that are
essential for the growth and economic progress of beneficiary
countries. Moreover, its developmental initiatives are
focused on developing countries that suffer from economic
challenges. The fund also embraces the process of sustainable
development in a balanced manner around the world.</p>
<p>ADFD also manages grants and loans provided by the UAE
Government by overseeing the administrative duties, quality
of the project and completion cycles. In the last three years,
ADFD and the UAE Government provided concessionary loans
and grants to launch major development projects in countries
most in need worth over AED 7 billion across 50 projects. These
projects included agriculture and land fertilization projects,
construction of water and electricity power plants, industrial
and mining project, and the provision of transportation and
housing as well as facilities for healthcare and social services.</p>
<p>The fund has also made investments at more than AED
900 million through several economic vehicles including
holding companies, investment portfolios and private equity.
These investments are part of the ADFD’s aim to expand the
provision of concessionary loans.</p>
<p>ADFD and Abu Dhabi Government have previously
implemented and are currently financing projects in the
Middle East and North, Eastern and Central Africa, as well

have spanned 321 projects across 58 countries with loans
and grants totaling AED 28.2 billion, and equity participation
valued at AED 902.1 million. To date ADFD its present capital
stands at AED 8 billion.</p> 
<p>The ADFD seeks to continuously improve its results by identifying and activating best practices by strengthening
cooperation with various national, regional and international
institutions. Based on this principle, ADFD plays a key role
as active member in the Coordination Group which was
established in 1975. In addition, it recently participated
in the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF
4), signed a MOU with the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI) to coordinate co-financing of
development projects and entered into an agreement with

   <b>Generating and transmitting progress</b>
        
<p>Taking the onus of spurring growth in the Arab region, ADFD participated in the construction of a reinforced
concrete dam across the river Nile near Merowe, some 350 km north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The dam
is about 1.1 km across the river with a total length of 9 km and 60 metres in height. The project includes all the
necessary civil works; the power plant to accommodate 10 generators each with a capacity of 125 megawatt and
the electromechanical works. The works also include the transmission lines and the connection to the national grid.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at utilising the huge hydropower potential of the country in generating electricity to meet the
increasing demand for power in order to assist the economic growth of the country. The project generates about
1250 megawatts of electricity that will be utilised for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes. ADFD stepped
in with its strength and acumen to cover the financial gap in the electromechanical works, thereby creating a
developmental success worth emulating.</p>

<p>It was with this belief and desire to give children,

opportunity to become positive contributors to the society,
that His Highness launched Dubai Cares in September 2007.
It was also launched with aim of helping achieve, by 2015,

Refugee Aid (ANERA), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
buildOn, Care International, The End Fund, Global Alliance for
Improved Nutrition (GAIN), Global Network, Idara-e-Taleemo-
Aagahi (ITA), Médecins Sans Frontières, Microsoft, Oxfam,
Partnership for Child Development (PCD), Plan International,
Room to Read, Save the Children, Scholastic, Teri Press,
UNICEF, UNRWA, Water Aid and World Food Program.</p> 
<p>Through its strategic partnerships with credible
organizations, Dubai Cares achieved its initial target of
reaching 1 million children in its first year. Today, in its fifth
year of operation, Dubai Cares is reaching 7 million children in
28 developing countries across the globe with its integrated
primary education programs.</p>
<p>Dubai Cares also commits significant resources towards
Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (ME&L) activities that
do not only ensure alignment with its vision and values,
but also become a source of valuable information on the
performance of programs.</p>
<p>An important achievement of Dubai Cares was its
transition from supporting to designing programs. This
transition became evident at the launch of the USD16 million
WASH-in-Schools initiative in Mali in 2010 where Dubai Cares,
in coordination with 5 implementing agencies (UNICEF,
OXFAM, CARE, Save the Children and WATERAID), designed
a framework for collaborative program implementation and
Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (ME&L). As part of this program, Dubai Cares is reaching 660,955 children in 726
schools.</p>

    <p>Another innovative program is its Home Grown School
Feeding program in Ghana. Launched in 2012, this 4-year
program will improve the education, health and nutrition
of over 320,000 primary school aged children and the
livelihoods of over 80,000 rural households. Based on the
principle “healthy children learn better”, the program will not
only benefit school children, but marginal rural communities
as well since the commodities required for producing the
nutritious meals for school children will be procured from
local farmers, prepared by local caterers and distributed
by local service providers. This creates a self-sustaining
cycle in which students receive the nutrition they need and
household incomes increase.</p>
<p>These programs have promoted Dubai Cares as a flexible
and innovative donor within the industry and paved the way
for new partnerships.</p>

   <b>Reducing Hardships in Gaza Strip</b>
        
<p>With Gaza facing humanitarian and economic
hardships that led to increasing poverty rates, Dubai
Cares launched a school feeding program to address
the rising malnutrition rates of 80,000 children. With
a limited diet and often times an empty stomach,
children are unable to absorb the material being
taught at school. If their situation is not improved,
children eventually drop out of school as they are
unable to keep up with the syllables. Even if small in
size, the daily food ration of one 60g fortified date
bar provided by the Dubai Cares’ program with the
World Food Program enhances children’s nutritional
intake and energy levels. Children are now more
motivated to come to school regularly as they are
guaranteed a food intake and can perform better
in their studies. Other than the children, different
stakeholders such as local markets are also being
impacted as the ingredients for the date bars are
purchased from local suppliers. The program is
bringing benefits on many fronts, from combating
short- term hunger to improving the cognitive
abilities of children and also supporting local
economic activity.</p>
