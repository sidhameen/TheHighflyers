    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>The roots of trading and business in the emirate of
Dubai date back to several centuries in history. In
the recent past, the formation of the United Arab Emirates
propelled it ahead as the nation’s hub for ambition with a
plethora of family business houses transitioning into global
conglomerates.</p>
<p>Substantially noteworthy among these is Al-Futtaim
Group, a name that is often evoked as one of the gems of the
nation’s diversified economy. It was established in the 1930s
as a trading business by the late Hamad Bin Majid Al-Futtaim,
one of the most prominent businessmen in Dubai and the
Gulf of those times. The group’s business journey started
with a shift by the founder from the traditional pearl diving
and trading model that dominated the region’s economy
to new lines of trading, investments and import activities
influenced by the shifts in demand for natural pearls globally.</p>
<p>Today, Al-Futtaim Group is one of the most progressive
regional business houses, headquartered in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates and present across the globe with varied
ventures. The group significantly expanded its business
operations in recent years through a strategic acquisition
plan and entered a number of new territories, increasing
its footprint beyond the GCC and greater Middle East to
encompass South East and North Asia, Australasia and
Europe.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/alfuttaim-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>Managing its growth tactically, it is structured into eight
operational divisions; automotive, electronics, engineering
and technologies, financial services, general services, joint
ventures, real estate & hospitality, and retail. The success
of Al-Futtaim is attributed to proactively managing change whilst upholding the values of integrity, service and social
responsibility. The majority of its businesses, built on a
portfolio of world-leading brands, dominate their respective
sectors. </p> 
<p>Its historical precedents have set the pace in capitalising
on emerging opportunities around the region. Rapid
development throughout the 1940s and 50s saw it establish
itself regionally as an integrated commercial, industrial and services organisation, positioning itself one of the leading
business houses in the lower Gulf region.</p>
<p>One of the group’s key features is the belief in
decentralisation, giving the heads of the operating companies
a high degree of functional autonomy and authority. This,
in turn, provides the group with essential flexibility, while
presenting individual employees with a clearly defined work
culture and sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>The group currently comprises a diverse range of
strategically-positioned operating subsidiaries and associate
companies, structured to keep the group ahead of local
competition, whilst matching the pace with the ever-evolving
global business scenario. The group’s continued investment
in world-class systems technology is clear evidence of its
commitment to maintain leading-edge performance and
service delivery.</p>
<p>Al-Futtaim Group represents many of the world’s leading
brands both in the UAE and the wider region. These names
include Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Volvo, Chrysler, Jeep and
Dodge, Panasonic, Toshiba, Sanyo, Alcatel, IKEA, Ace,
Marks & Spencer, Toys R Us, Seiko, Raymond Weil, Westar,
Kolber and Minato Pearls, in addition to its in-house brands
that include Plug-Ins retail stores and AFTRON consumer
electronics.</p>

    <img src="images/alfuttaim-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
<p>The group has also formed several subsidiaries in the GCC
nations, while also exporting its expertise as well as unique
concepts beyond the region, from Singapore to Pakistan to
Egypt as well as Europe and CIS.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Al-Futtaim Group formed a presence
through the acquisition of Robinson and Company (RCL),
world-renowned for its department and specialty stores such
as Robinsons, John Little, Principles, and Fat Face, among others in Singapore and Malaysia. This move established the
group as a significant presence in one of the most buoyant
economies in the South-east Asia region. Furthermore, it has
been involved in automobile engineering sector in Pakistan
for over three decades and continues to form new industrial
collaboration agreements.</p>
<p>The latest, most innovative development undertaken
by Al-Futtaim is the Dubai Festival City - a ‘city within a
city’ that covers 1,600 acres and stretches along 4km of the
Dubai Creek shoreline, built at an investment of over USD 2
billion by the group. This waterfront destination showcases
prestigious retailers, an international gourmet culture, a golf
course and an entertainment retreat.</p>
<p>Located at the heart of Dubai Festival City is the mall that
hosts over 600 shops including 25 flagship stores, over 100
restaurants, cafés and bistros, a cinema complex, and a vast
entertainment centre. Surging forward with its approach to
expanding its success beyond home, the group launched its
Festival City concept in Doha and Cairo, which are currently
progressing in phases.</p> 
<p>As part of the commitment to the communities in which
it operates, Al-Futtaim believes in training and developing
nationals. By equipping talented individuals with the skills
required in the commercial workplace, it effectively builds rewarding careers for nationals at every level. It has a longstanding
policy of positively recruiting indigenous nationals
throughout its businesses and has a clearly structured
programme in place designed to attract and retain talented
nationals. It also invests considerably in the sustainability of
the planet in the form of energy-efficiency and eco-friendly
measures.</p>

<p>At present, Al-Futtaim Group employs in excess of 40,000
people and operates through more than 100 companies
bearing its name, continuing a proud tradition with its everexpanding
footprint spanning beyond the GCC and Greater
Middle East to encompass South East and North Asia,
Australasia and Europe.</p>

   <b>Festivities for everyone around the region</b>
        
<p>The Festival City brand was formed to represent a type of inspirational lifestyle achievable through the creation of
mixed-use urban communities. The flagship development for the brand in Dubai drew inspiration from international
destinations such as St. Mark’s Square in Venice, Darling Harbour in Sydney, Covent Garden in London and the
Croissette in Cannes.</p>
<p>It showcased, yet again, the fact that Al-Futtaim Group as a conglomerate consistently delivered iconic experiences
and landmarks. As the owner, developer and operator of the globally-acknowledged Festival City brand, it chose
Cairo, Egypt and Doha, Qatar as the next destinations for this successful ‘city within a city’ concept.</p>
<p>On 5th September 2010, Al-Futtaim signed a QAR 6 billion joint venture agreement to construct this state-ofthe-
art entertainment and retail complex. October 2011 marked the ground-breaking for the Doha Festival City,
owned and developed by Bawabat Al-Shamal Real Estate Company (BASREC), which comprises four primary
shareholders including Al-Futtaim Real Estate Services, Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), and private Qatari investors.
Doha Festival City is the largest super-regional, mixed-use development currently under construction in the
Middle East and is located 15km north of downtown Doha.</p>
<p>IKEA, the Al-Futtaim franchise brand, which forms part of the city’s offerings, opened its doors in March 2013.
Doha Festival City upon completion in 2016 is slated to span almost 335,000 sq mt with nearly 270,000 sq mt
set aside for retail space. Acknowledging its uniqueness, it was awarded the prestigious honour of “Best Future
Project” at the Global RLI Awards 2012 held in London.</p>
<p>Furthering its success, the group also launched the Cairo Festival City, a master-planned community covering
over 3 million sq mt, comprising residential communities, a retail resort with over 300 shops and services, over 100
restaurants, premium office space, an automotive park, and a school. This city is slated to be completed by 2018
with several phases already operational.</p>
<p>The strategic approach of Al-Futtaim Group has seen the Festival City brand become the mainstay for leisure,
shopping, residential and entertainment in the three nations that it is currently present in, creating a unique
success for the region and occupying a place-of-pride.</p>

   <b>Breakthrough category in consumer electronics</b>
        
<p>As the innovation in gadgets and in turn, the demand, saw
a manifold increase in the 1990s, Al-Futtaim Group saw an
opportunity to apply its expertise acquired in the retail sector
to spin-off its own brand. The year 1994 saw the group launch
AFTRON, offering consumer electronics and home appliances
that offer high-quality in the mid-priced segment, which has
seen a rise across the region and beyond.</p>
<p>AFTRON was started with the aim to provide better quality of
life to the customers by delivering range of futuristic products
that are reliable, practical and affordable. The business model
involved outsourcing manufacturing to renowned names at
world-class facilities with stringent checks for quality and
reliability.</p>
<p>Starting with increasing availability in the UAE at all leading
electronic stores, it formed an exclusive showroom in Dubai as
well as distribution and export divisions. Expanding rapidly, the
brand has quickly established itself as preferred name. Today,
AFTRON is distributed and serviced in more than 30 countries in
GCC, Middle East, South Asia, Africa and CIS.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the group is also driving its ‘Go Green’ philosophy
with introduction of environmentally- friendly and safe-to-use
products. Some of the key AFTRON products that manifest this
belief include air conditioners that consumer 30 per cent less,
food waste disposers that reduce household food waste by up
to 40%, CFC-free refrigerator and energy-saving lamps.</p>

successful sale of a shipment of rice husks from India,
the Al Yousuf LLC has now grown into a multi-million dirham
conglomerate a success that merges with the country’s
unprecedented rapid growth.</p>
<p>Born of one man’s vision, enterprise and drive, the Juma
Al Majid group of companies had a modest start in the year
1950. But with the growth of Dubai as the commercial hub
of the region, the group has emerged a strong leader in all

and social awareness has become ingrained in all aspects of
the business and is truly responsible for the group’s unrivaled

<p>During the early years, the organization was primarily
involved in trading activities. As the Emirates forged
themselves into a single nation, a pressing need was felt to
diversify into other areas of commercial activity to contribute
to the fledging nation’s economy. For this, heavy investment
was undertaken in the core sector of construction which has
in the long run benefited both the country as well as the
group.</p>

been instrumental in making the Hyundai brand achieve the
market dominance that it currently enjoys.</p>

the Juma Al Majid Group has been overseeing the planning,
design, development and construction of major landmark projects, not only in the United Arab Emirates but all over
the world including the United States Of America, United

stage with the production of design briefs and competitive
selection of consultants. During the design development
stage, they review the consultant’s design, technically
and commercially. They also review and approve contract
management functions in liaison with the consultant, thus
ensuring that quality of materials and workmanship meet
Juma Al Majid’s exacting standards and that the projects are
completed on time and within the budget.</p>

   <b>Al Majid Group - A pioneer in international partnerships</b>
        
<p>Al Majid group relationship with General Electric (GE) of the USA is one of the oldest and big lesson from the UAE’s
values of hardworking and perseverence in business could push business beyond boundaries.
Juma Al Majid the Groups chairman recalls how he began an association with General Electric in the 1950s. He says
he came across refrigerators produced by the company — at the time not available in Dubai — at the Al Qusaibi
showroom in Bahrain.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, he pretended to check the refrigerator, while picking up the guarantee card with the
company’s details. He contacted GE once back in Dubai. But his first deal with GE was not a great success. He
bought 200 air conditioners directly from the GE dealer in Lebanon at a discounted price, as the order was quite
a substantial one in those times.</p>
<p>However, it took him two years to sell all the stock as there was no proper electricity supply then. But things
changed for the best as the UAE started developing with first class infrastructure and electricity. By the 1970s,
his company was the second-largest in terms of sales of GE products, including up to 700,000 air-conditioners a
year. Even today GE is among the main supplier of electronics in Jumal Al Majid Home Appliances Department.</p>

   <b>A long-term success in Tanzania</b>
        
<p>S.S. Lootah Group’s global business and investment
arm, S.S. Lootah International was set up to support
its international business and bring global expertise
to the UAE. One of the key successes was achieved
by Lootah BCGas, the leading operating gas utility in
the UAE, when it initiated operations in Tanzania in the
year 2002. After the successful completion of 3 phases
of gas infrastructure projects, its positive impact was
evident in key economic sectors from tourism and
hospitality to transportation and manufacturing.
Moreover, the training centre established to provide
Tanzanian workforce with technical training emerged
as a role model for sustainable project development
and management in the country. The local workforce
is today well prepared to ensure long-term success of
the business and future projects in the sector.</p>
<p>This and many other successes exemplify the strength
of S.S. Lootah International. Its expansive list of global
partners includes State Group Inc. - a Canadian MEP
Contractor, Fraunhofer- a leading European appliedresearch
organisation, GLOBE Foundation - a pioneer
in sustainable events, SGM and TEC.INN. - Italy-based
construction testing and retrofit specialists, KMH
Healthcare Services – Canada-based diagnostic health
services and University Medical Centre Hamburg
Eppendorf – a leading German hospital, among others.</p>
<p>Today, S.S. Lootah International’s portfolio consists
of multi-billion dollar projects across Asia, Africa
and Europe, with wholly-owned subsidiaries in India
and Canada. S.S. Lootah International continues to
expand its reach and pursue strategic partnerships to
serve the region’s ever-growing development needs,
through affordable and adaptable technologies that
generate economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>

        <p>Damas is the Middle East’s leading international
jewellery and watch retailer. Founded in 1907 in Syria,
the company was lured by the UAE’s prospective business
and moved to Dubai in 1955 where it found its headquarters.</p>
<p>Damas traces its origins back to when Mohammed
Tawfique Abdullah – grandfather of now Damas shareholdersstarted
crafting, designing and customizing jewelry in Syria.
Abdullah’s business migrated to the United Arab Emirates in
1955 when his son opened, in Dubai, a goldsmith shop under
the name Al Abdullah Jewellery Traders LLC (AAJT), which
showcased the Damas jewelry brand for the very first time.</p>
<p>The group opened its first retail whole sale gold operations
in the emirate in 1970, By the end of 1985, the Damas Group
had expanded with several retail stores throughout the UAE
and in 1988, the Group launched its first branded jewellery
line under the Harmony brand.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/damas-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
<p>currently the Damas brands – which are spread across
various jewelry types including diamonds, gemstones, gold,
and pearl- are Boudour, Farasha, Farha, Fior, Fulla, Harmony,
Hayati, Jawaher, Kiku, Legacy, Manthourah, Nakshatra, and
Solitaire. Other product offerings include Damas watches,
an articles collection, and a men’s collection of primarily
bangles and cufflinks.</p> 
<p>Damas operates around 450 stores distributed across 18
countries, most of which are located in the GCC region. The
company has grown from a UAE-based retailer into a global
brand name, and is also the retailer for a large portfolio of
renowned global luxury brands.</p>
<p>Damas sells jewellery and watches through four main
store formats, which are uniquely positioned to address
different consumer segment needs. Specifically, the Les
Exclusives Stores offer high-end luxury products; Semi-
Exclusives Stores offer stylish and sophisticated products for
the discerning consumer; and the Damas 22K and 18K Stores
offer trendy, fashionable and stylish products and brands at
competitive prices. In addition to the four principal store
formats, Damas also operates other outlets such as exclusive
watch stores and Mono-brand boutiques.</p>
<p>By 2000, the Group had established retail operations
in Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Jordan. In 2002, the Group
expanded its operations to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and by
2004, the Group had further strengthened its presence within
and beyond the Middle East.</p>

    <p>As it strived to become a leading multinational in the
jewellery and fashion industry and a house to international
brands, Damas has had a number of celebrities endorsing it as
their ambassador among these are Esha Gupta and the Arabic
pop singer Nancy Ajram. The group has won several awards
for its dedicated quality and reliability, among these are Dubai
Quality Appreciation Award Program (DQAP). It has also
won the Tahtian Pearl Trophy competition in 2006 organised
by Diamond Trading Company (DTC)- DeBeers and Perles de
Tahiti. Damas was also listed on NASDAQ Dubai in 2008</p>

   <b>Damas: Making a success in Saudi Arabia</b>
        
<p>In 2002 Damas expanded and opened another retail store in
Sharafiya, Jeddah of Saudi Arabia to spread their Dubai success
to the rest of the region. The retail shop was named Damas Saudi
Arabia Company Ltd and was operating as a subsidiary of Damas
Jewellery LLC.</p>
<p>Damas International in Dubai announced in April 2011 that a subsidiary
had acquired a controlling stake in its joint venture operation,
Damas Saudi Arabia Company. The officials said in a statement that
the Damas KSA stake was purchased for an undisclosed sum by
Damas Jewellery, increasing its stake to 98 percent. The acquisition
illustrated the optimism the Damas International had for their
jewellery business in the kingdom. The Saudi market is a core market
for Damas, and the acquisition was to help provide a platform for the
group to service this key market more fully.</p>

        <p>The UAE has a highly evolved taste for luxury goods
and refined living, which along with the GCC nations,
leads the world in terms of spends in this sector. As one of the
foremost UAE family businesses in this field, the Paris Gallery
Group of Companies is not only a pioneering commercial
entity, but also very much a part of the social and cultural
weft and warp of the country.</p>
<p>Paris Gallery Group is a privately-held business group in
the Middle East with core interests in beauty and lifestyle
products and services. It is a brand that has become
synonymous with luxury itself with its presence and influence
extending across the entire geographic region.</p>
<p>Building on its strategy to be the best in the luxury
sector, the group has successfully developed a diversified
and regional portfolio of retail and distribution businesses
over the past years. To ensure sustainable development and
long-term value creation, the group anticipates consumer
demands and continually identifies value-adding investment
opportunities through product and service innovations,
partnerships, mergers, acquisitions, franchising and other
international expansion strategies.</p>
<p>What started as a single shop over three decades ago has
now grown to a retail chain of over 80 stores covering more
than 1.8 million sq. ft. of shopping space located in prime
retail addresses across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
Bahrain, encompassing a diverse portfolio of iconic brands.</p>

<p>Paris Gallery, the retail division of the Group, offers a
premium collection of over 500 international brands across
several product categories including fragrances, cosmetics,
watches, jewellery, eyewear and accessories. Through its
wide range of products, the brand completes the portrait of a desirable lifestyle. The group also has a dedicated specialty
retail concept for watches, the Watch Gallery, which offers
connoisseurs of exquisite timepieces a luxurious boutique
environment.</p> 
<p>The reputation of the Paris Gallery Group of Companies is
completed by an array of designer-wear, footwear, handbags
and accessories. The stores are home to some of the most
luxurious and premium badges in the world of fashion, such
as Burberry, Salvatore Ferragamo, Etro, Aigner, Cartier,
Sergio Rossi and Roberto Cavalli.</p>
<P>Although the Group is well known for its flagship retail
stores Paris Gallery and Watch Gallery, its business activities
go beyond that to include distribution and franchising. The
Group’s strong and specialised distribution network forms
the back-end of its remarkable success. Al Fahim Enterprises,
Gulf Beauty International, Tazweed and Time Bridge are all
success stories in their own right and together create the
pillars for the Group to build on its retail success.</p>
<P>While Time Bridge is a leading and fast-expanding
distribution and brand management company in the Middle
East specializing in international watches and accessories
brands, Tazweed was formed in 2006 to provide dedicated
representation to niche, luxury and oriental fragrances,
skincare and accessory brands exclusively distributed by Paris
Gallery Group. Aside from these, Gulf Beauty International is the Middle East’s leading distributor of premium beauty
products.</p>
<P>As a staunch supporter of local government initiatives
on native workforce development, the Paris Gallery
Group of Companies endeavours to build on its reputation
as an employer of choice and a responsible corporate
citizen. Towards this, the group signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with Dubai Cares extending support
to the primary education programs being implemented
by Dubai Cares and benefiting over 7 million children in 28
developing countries.</p>

<p>As the parent company to a collection of businesses,
Paris Gallery Group provides essential strategic direction
and operational support services to ensure the commercial
optimisation of all business units. Presently, Paris Gallery
Group has become a retail conglomerate renowned across
the Middle East with more than 3,500 employees and a
customer base of more than 1 million in the UAE. The group
has consistently recorded year on year revenue growth of
more than 15% for the past 3 years and continues to make
inroads into new markets while strengthening its leading
market positions in its stronghold territories. The group
has won several commendations including the FIFI Arabia -
Retailer of the Year Award twice and also has the distinction
of entering the Guinness World Records twice.</p>

        <p>The Dubai-based BinHendi Enterprises is a diversified
conglomerate and one of the leading business
establishments in the UAE. Its key focus areas are retail and
hospitality, having introduced more than 75 world-renowned
brands to the UAE and the region in the fields of fashion,
watches, jewellery, accessories, furniture, fine dining and
more. The group’s core philosophy is aimed at providing
quality and luxury to consumers. It is driven by strong and
professional business acumen that reflects the UAE’s focus
on maintaining a diversified economy.</p>
<p>Based in one of the world’s most liberated trading hubs,
the company capitalised on the unique opportunities that
emerged with the UAE’s founding. Recognising a growing
consumer interest in international products and fashion
brands, it established the nation’s first exclusive fashion
boutique - Pierre Cardin. This initial success propelled the
company to fill several untapped niches in the Middle Eastern
markets. Its unique approach, favourable government
policies and an in-depth knowledge of consumer preferences,
enabled BinHendi Enterprises to meet the growing demand
for high quality products and services.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>In the field of accessories, it retails small leather goods,
writing instruments and lifestyle accessories, aside from
luggage choices. Its real estate entity Alpha Properties
manages and markets premium commercial and residential
real estate in Dubai, while Binhendi Construction is a
contracting company specialising in design and building.
Some of its keys projects accomplished till date are Audi-Porsche Showroom and Emirates Hills, among others. Its
industrial division, Emirates Coats, deals in the application of
high performance paints and primers for decorative, marine
as well as specialised projects.</p>
<p>The company’s portfolio of international brands, in its
flagship field of fashion retailing, comprises Brioni, Hugo
Boss, Paul and Shark, Artioli and Shanghai Tang, to name
a few. BinHendi Enterprises, as a pioneer of high fashion
in the region, took its UAE success to India as Hugo Boss’s
franchise partner. It launched the premium-clothing brand’s
first showroom in New Delhi in the year 2003 and just a year
later, opened the second one in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Under the brand name, Baituti, it provides interiors design
consultancy, furnishing and fit-out services and retailing of
designer European furniture brands in the UAE. BinHendi’s
event and floral design firm, iwishflowers was established to
provide specialised decorative services. BinHendi Jewellery,
formed in 1988, is one of the region’s most successful retail
and distribution venture, offering exclusive watches from
Ulysse Nardin, Jacob and Co. Nubeo and Porsche Design. </p> 

<p>One of the company’s major successes came in the form of
BinHendi Hospitality, which offers a wide selection of dining
options, not just in the UAE, but across the Middle East and
India. These include Café Havana, Mini Chinese Restaurant,
China Times Restaurant, Japengo Café, Second Cup, Ruby Tuesday, Burj Al Hamam and Duck King, among others.
Showcasing its acumen to diversify into newer sectors, the
company capitalised on the presence of large number of
expatriates in the UAE by establishing Federal Exchange in
the year 1990. Furthermore, it acquired City7 TV, the UAE’s
first independent, locally-produced, English language TV
station. The 24-hour infotainment channel currently has
11 programmes that are aimed specifically at bringing the
nation’s cultures together.</p>
<p>Expanding further, the company acquired American
Eastern Dubai in the year 1998, thereby venturing into
importing and marketing of a wide range of consumer
brands like Jolen Bleach Crème, Landscape structures, Texas
Instruments and others by taking advantage of its vast retail
presence.</p>

<p>BinHendi Enterprises currently operates 29 highly
successful fashion, jewellery, accessory and food retail outlets,
while its trading division reaches in excess of 1,000 retailers,
making it a leader in one of the world’s most affluent markets.
Growing exponentially from the UAE, its operations now
encompass the Middle East and India, employing more than
3,000 people from the world over. Playing a key role in the
development of the national workforce is its Emiratisation
drive, AJYAL, which recruits, trains and retains Emiratis
within the company’s ventures.</p>

   <b>A home-grown international success in dining</b>
        
<p>As the global economic downturn affected sales
of luxury brands, BinHendi Enterprises introduced
more affordable products, while shifting its F-and-B
franchises into expansion mode. Japengo Café,
the highly successful café concept from BinHendi
Hospitality, is a prime example of the company’s
strategy of taking its F&B success beyond the UAE.
Offering an eclectic mix of international cuisines with
a strong Asian influence, its first overseas outlet was
launched in the year 2008 in Oman. Moving beyond,
it also opened the second branch in Mumbai, India,
making it one of the first UAE-based restaurant
chains to form a presence in this nation. Japengo
Café presently has 13 outlets, including 11 in the UAE,
with many overseas branches on the anvils.</p>
<p>Showcasing its acumen in F-and-B franchise
operations, BinHendi also launched Second Cup in
the UAE as the first international representative for
this popular Canadian coffee house. Starting in the
year 2003, the partnership saw BinHendi fast expand
this chain to Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Syria and Turkey, among others. The company also
established the Second Cup School of Business in
Dubai, which provides management and leadership
training programmes.</p>
<p>BinHendi Enterprises continues to make the most of
the strong business relations that the UAE shares with
the world. Talking advantage of the rising demand for
unique dining options in the region, it presently has
plans to further expand its in-house and franchise
brands across the Middle East.</p>

        <p>Saleh Bin Lahej, a young UAE entrepreneur, took the
words of encouragement of the late Sheikh Rashid
bin Saeed Al Maktoum to establish a construction company
under consideration; as this is a tradition of the Sheikh to
encourage young people to take the lead in building their
country’s economy. Accordingly, the young entrepreneur set
up his first company in 1975 and named it Saleh Constructions.</p>
<p>The Saleh Constructions Company that was established 38
years ago has turned to Saleh Bin Lahej Group, one of the
largest family diversified-organizations in the Middle East.
The Group has thrived in success making not only in the UAE
but also beyond. Today, it comprises three main divisions:
Construction, Hospitality and Publishing.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/binlahej-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
<p>Building 150 houses for nationals in Khourfakan, a city
in the Emirate of Sharjah, was the first project of Saleh
Constructions. Jumeirah Beach Residence, The Springs,
Sharjah Court and Emergency and Trauma Centre are a few
examples of the remarkable recent construction projects
completed in the UAE.</p> 
<p>Through the successive years, the group’s involvement in the construction sector was reinforced by establishing
several companies serving the different segments: Bin Lahej
Aluminum, Bin Lahej Electromechanical, Batimat Building
Materials Trading and IDEA Mobili Building Materials.</p>
<p>These companies were initially established to compliment
the operation of Saleh Constructions but they have grown
to become among the leaders locally. Today for example,
Bin Lahej Electromechanical – known as Bin Lahej Air
Conditioning – has become one of the largest electrical
companies in the UAE. It achieved a phenomenal growth and
carried out turnkey projects: over 800 villas and many multistory
buildings all over the UAE.</p>
<p>The group established a hospitality division in 1997 by
operating restaurants throughout the UAE starting with a
Chili’s restaurant in Al Garhoud, Dubai. By committing to
an aggressive and increasingly diverse expansion plan, the
Hospitality Division has successfully brought a countless
number of leading restaurants under its management. Chili’s,
the flagship brand, occupies a central position within the restaurant portfolio. It has dominated the market operating
20 restaurants across the UAE and 2 outlets in Oman.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    <p>The taste of success demanded the group to sail into
different realms. In 1996, it added a third division “Publishing
Division” by establishing Printmasters & 360 Creative
as an advertising and marketing consultency firm. The
company is based in Beverly Hills with collaborative offices
in Dubai and China. It provides marketing communication,
branding, advertising, business consulting and public
relations solutions. Within a few years of operation, it has
built a respected number of high-profile clients including
BIODERMA, Pfizer, MTV, Nickelodeon and WalTech.</p>
<p>A company with a single business activity operating in a
small geographic market in the 1970s turned into a group
of diversified businesses is an example of a UAE-based
international investor that has not only crossed the UAE
borders but also succeeded in taking the lead in the different
races.</p>

        <p>The rise of small businesses at the end of the nineties
and in the early of the new millennium has significantly
contributed to the rising need of new business consultancy
companies in the UAE. Dubai Consultancy (DC) as one of
the leading consultancies in the region was established
in 2005 in response to the overworked small businesses
that had more obligations than time. With a small team of
professionals, the company began building its clients’ base
of different businesses in different sectors.</p>
<p>Since inception, Dubai Consultancy has realized that a
consultancy company’s success is determined by its success
in operating as a unified team. Dedicated hard working
and commitment are greatly considered when it comes
to selecting an employee at the company. In addition, it
has been following strict guideline in order to build its
competitive team. Thus, treating each employee with
respect and listening to their input on how to continually
improve the company’s service goals, not tolerating
discrimination of any kind and encouraging all in problem
solving creativity and having an open door policy which
encourages interactions, discussions and the exchange of
ideas have become the norms of Dubai Consultancy that
were indeed behind its local and international achievements.</p>

remarkable footprints across the different segments of consultancy from business advisory and consultancy to

<p>Being a part of a prominent site that posses an
outstanding reputation in the international market and
accessible to diversified businesses, Dubai Consultancy’s
business and financial professionals have gone through
an extensive expertise that enabled them to take the
company’s operations beyond the region’s borders. From
its headquarter in Dubai, DC reached clients in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia region. Within the events
management segment, the company has successfully
staged the Ghana Trade and Investment Exhibition 2008, the
UAE-France Partnership Forum 2007, the UAE-Singapore
