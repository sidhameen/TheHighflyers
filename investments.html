        <p>The ambitious forays of the UAE Government as well
        as investors from the nation have a common thread
        binding them, in that they are keenly focussed on identifying
        future trends while ensuring economically diverse investing.
        This is all the more true when it comes to the Abu Dhabibased
        Mubadala, one of the world’s leading multi-national
        investment and development conglomerates of the present
        times.</p>
        <p>Mubadala - the Arabic word for ‘exchange’ - was
        established by the Government of Abu Dhabi in the year 2002
        as a principal agent in the diversification of
        Abu Dhabi’s economy. Within a span of
        just over a decade, it has successfully
        marked its presence in some of the most
        challenging sectors including aerospace,
        metals, information and communications
        technology, oil and gas, renewable energy and semiconductors.</p>
        <p>In line with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, the
        company’s mandate is to generate sustainable, long-term
        returns for its shareholder, while also delivering strong
        economic benefits for Abu Dhabi and the United Arab
        Emirates. Its investment activities focus on reducing 
        Abu Dhabi’s reliance on oil and oil-related products by
        diversifying the Emirate’s industrial base to develop a multisector
        economy.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/mubadala-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
        <p>Mubadala is building upon Abu Dhabi’s competitive
        advantages to grow businesses, in partnership with
        established international organisations in diverse priority
        sectors. Many of these investments have seen Mubadala
        expand its presence in emerging markets, in recognition of
        the long-term opportunities and growth potential that they
        offer.</p>
        <p>Mubadala’s activities also extend to the establishment,
        construction and provision of social infrastructure in Abu
        Dhabi, particularly in the sectors of healthcare and real estate,
        in support of the Government’s development strategy and
        the wider growth of the private sector in the UAE.</p>
        <p>The company’s investment philosophy is centred on the
        founding of world-class partnerships. Its current partnerships
        encompass a broad range of initiatives and areas of joint
        cooperation with some of the world’s leading businesses and
        are always based on a shared vision and collaboration.</p>
        <p>Its stellar list of international partners includes Airbus,
        Boeing, The Carlyle Group, Cleveland Clinic, EBX, GE,
        Imperial College London, Pramerica and Total among
        others. The common thread that runs through all Mubadala
        investments and assets is the opportunities they enable for
        current and future generations, from employment in entirely
        new sectors to the educational and healthcare infrastructure
        to support the nation.</p> 
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/mubadala-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>In terms of individual sectors, Mubadala has a stake
    in companies that have continued to deliver formidable
    successes. An example of its world-class approach is evidenced
    in the information and communications technology field,
    where its key assets comprise renowned names such as Al
    Yah Satellite Communications Company (Yahsat), Bayanat,
    Damballa, Emirates Integrated Communications (du),
    Etisalat Nigeria, Injazat Data Systems and Prodea Systems. It
    has also invested in conglomerates such as Advanced Micro
    Devices (AMD), EMI Music Publishing that hold a highly
    regarded position in their respective industries.</p>
    
    
    <p>The common approach that runs through all Mubadala
    investments and assets is the opportunity provided to
    current and future generations. It consistently provides
    career opportunities to young UAE Nationals through its
    Emiratisation strategy with an ever-increasing proportion
    of Emiratis working for the company in both managerial and
    engineering roles.</p>
    <p>Keeping an eye on a sustainable future for the
    planet, Mubadala is also advancing the development,
    commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy
    solutions and clean technologies, establishing Abu Dhabi as
    a global centre of excellence in the renewable energy and
    clean technology sector. It also holds a stake in London Array
    Limited, the world’s largest offshore wind farm, which will be
    generating enough electricity to power nearly half a million
    homes.</p>
    <p>Mubadala’s success is reflective of the prudence of UAE
    Government’s its policies and initiatives, which have included
    a number of steps to accelerate the process of economic
    diversification and growth in recent decades. Complementing
    its financial acumen, Mubadala has one of the highest credit
    ratings in the Middle East and is recognised for its ongoing
    commitment to transparency as well as adherence to robust
    corporate governance and compliance practices.</p> 
    
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/mubadala-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Having established itself with a single project in the
    regional energy sector, Mubadala is now an active investor
    in more than 12 industries around the world with over 33,000
    employees. As of 2012, its portfolio stood at more than USD
    50 billion, increasing above 15% compared to the previous
    year. Further on, its total revenue for the year 2012 was over</p>
    <p>USD 8.5 billion, showcasing an increase of more than 12%
    over 2011. Most significantly, till date, Mubadala has created
    over 10,000 jobs locally and made significant contributions
    to the GDP and the development of Abu Dhabi, which
    continues to be its key mandate.</p>

   <b>Creating a booming healthcare sector with international partners</b>
        
    <p>Mubadala is contributing to a thriving healthcare sector by
    providing world-class facilities for the residents of the UAE and
    the wider region. It is focused on addressing the region’s most
    pressing healthcare needs through the creation of specialist
    facilities. This is a task that it is achieving in collaboration with
    internationally-recognised medical organisations such as John
    Hopkins Medicine International, Imperial College London, and
    Cleveland Clinic. The goal for the company at every step in this
    sector is to bring the highest standards of clinical expertise to
    the region and reduce the need for patients to travel overseas
    for treatment.</p>
    <p>One of its most important projects in this area is the Imperial
    College London Diabetes Centre (ILCDC), a one-stop, state-ofthe-
    art, out-patient facility that specialises in diabetes treatment,
    research, training and public health awareness. It currently has
    two centres – one in Abu Dhabi and another in Al Ain.
    The purpose-built centres, operated in partnership with the
    UK’s Imperial College London, provide the highest level of
    specialised patient care, from first diagnosis to the management
    of all complications associated with diabetes, and has offered
    diabetes prevention, education and treatment to more than
    160,000 people.</p>
    <p>ILCDC holds the Joint Commission International (JCI) Clinical
    Care Program Certification (CCPC) in Diabetes Management and
    JCI Accreditation for Ambulatory Care. Showcasing its expertise
    is the fact that it is the first facility in the Middle East and the
    third globally to hold JCI’s highly-acclaimed CCPC for the clinical
    management of diabetes. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Mubadala, ILCDC is enabling easy access to global standards in
    healthcare for the region and beyond.</p>

        “As a national company, we truly believes in our responsibility as private sector in the developing and strengthening of our nations economy, and that’s why we will never leave a stone unturned in search for new industries

around the globe via different investments and partnerships.
Following our founder’s vision from the early beginnings, we at Al Ahli Holding

We don’t believe that there is competitions between national companies, but
that there is an economic integration, and that’s why we encourage, train and

        <p>Al Ahli Holding Group (AAHG) is an Emirati corporation
        with a colorful portfolio of over 30 companies covering
        various sectors including Construction and infrastructure,
        Real Estate, Basic Materials, Technology, Transportation &
        Logistics, Trading and Marketing, Lifestyle and Fitness, in
        addition to Entertainment and hospitality.</p>
        <p>This multi-disciplined portfolio is the fruit of a 40 years
        evolution that begun in 1968 when Nasser Khammas, a
        young entrepreneur from the Emirate of Fujairah, started
        his first business in the retail industry by establishing Al Ahli
        chain of supermarkets.</p>
        <p>From the early beginnings, Nasser Khammas always
        looked at, and was open to, innovative ways to expand and
        diversify the activities and sectors of his businesses, and
        since then, AAHG’s expansion was evident and limitless,
        penetrating multiple business fields and entering new
        markets.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/alahli-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    
        <p>Today AAHG employs around 8,000 people, and although
        it is based in the United Arab Emirates with offices in Dubai,
        Abu Dhabi and Fujairah, it has representing offices operating
        in Germany, Spain (Madrid), Panama, USA (Los Angeles
        & New York), Mexico, Nicaragua, Colombia, Costa Rica,
        Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Angola, Nigeria, South
        Africa, Egypt, Hong Kong and India, In addition to Oman and
        Qatar.</p>
        
       <p>AAHG’s involvement in the construction sector
        commenced in the early 1990s by establishing Emirates
        General Contracting. It has successfully delivered a variety
        of projects including industrial, residential and commercial
        buildings within the UAE.</p>
        <p>As the construction industry thrived in the UAE and the gulf
        region, AAHG’s construction and infrastructure industries
        rapidly grew and the need to establish new companies that
        specialize in the different segments of the construction
        sector became indispensable. As a result, the Gulf Spring
        Contracting and Al Bawadi Contracting were born.</p>
        <p>The demand for building materials also grew, and AAHG
        realized a huge gap in the market and quickly seized the
        opportunity by establishing the Emirates Engineering
        Services and Factories which specialize in design, fabrication,
        and erection of pre-engineered steel buildings as well as
        hot rolled steel structures, and Al Ahli Aluminum, one of the
        leading aluminum, glass and cladding contractors in the UAE
        today.</p>

    <img src="images/alahli-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
    <p>Committed to his strategy of diversifying the group’s
    activities, Mr. Khammas continued to establish strong
    presence in a wide range of new business fields, including the
    establishment of the state of the art Al Ahli Printing Press in 
    1996, equipped with latest High-Tech printing machines
    able to cover the growing printing demands in the UAE and
    Middle East back then.</p>
    <p>Entering the new millennium, the economical and
    technological growth in the UAE reached unprecedented
    levels, and new industries and technologies were highly in
    demand. That’s when Al Ahli IT Solutions joined the extensive 
    portfolio of the group consulting and outsourcing solutions
    to an impressive client base. Al Ahli Plastics industries soon
    followed manufacturing almost unlimited variety of quality
    plastic products that were highly in demand, and within
    less than two years, the company had to expand so fast it
    reached a production capacity of 20.000 Tons per annum.</p>
	<p>During the following years, AAHG did not only maintain
    its momentum, but it enlarged its enrollment in different
    business fields faster than ever establishing a wide new range
    of companies such as Al Ahli General Transport, Arabtec
    Consultants, Al Dhiyafa Residence, Al Ahli General Trading,
    Al Ahli Advertising and Distribution and Artline Advertising
    to name a few.</p>
	<p>Soon after the announcement of DUBAILAND® project,
    AAHG launched the Dubai Outlet City, a US$1 billion mixed
    use development covering approx 10 million sq ft featuring
    retail, offices, hotels, furnished apartments, a conference
    centre and other facilities. The well-known Dubai Outlet Mall
    is the centerpiece of this first of a kind concept in the Middle
    East hosting over 800 premium and top fashion brands in individual 
    and multi-branded stores.</p>
    <p>After reaching this huge local success, It was only a matter
    of time before AAHG started looking for a global presence
    through long-standing relationships and partnerships with
    several international companies, which opened new doors
    for new markets, business and industries altogether.</p>

    <p>Al Ahli Holding Group truly believes in the private sector’s
    responsibility to contribute back to society, and that’s why
    Al Ahli Holding Group was one of the first private sector
    companies in the UAE to create a fully dedicated Corporate
    Social Responsibility division.</p>
    <p>The CSR division of Al Ahli Holding Group focuses on
    entrepreneurship and on helping, training and empowering
    the youth to start their own sustainable businesses. Today,
    CSR Al Ahli Holding Group has succeeded, with the generous
    help of the governments and partners, in implementing
    programs in Argentina, Jordan, Brazil, UK and Lebanon
    changing the lives of 200 youth from (UAE, Jordan, Argentina,
    Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Greece, Lebanon, India and
    UK).</p>
    <p>Other local and international initiatives by CSR Al Ahli
    Holding Group included The Global Youth Forum that

        <p>The Abu Dhabi Investment Council is an investment arm
        of the Government of Abu Dhabi. Its headquarters are
        situated in Abu Dhabi, an ideal location for its worldwide
        operations and place it in close proximity to its local
        investments and senior government officials. The positive
        UAE business environment and infrastructure, and the
        double taxation treaties entered into by the government,
        have aided the Council in attracting successful professionals
        from over 30 nationalities to the organisation, as well as
        supported the Council’s operations globally.</p>

        <p>In April 2007, the Council started its operations and was
        given the responsibility of investing part of the government’s
        surplus financial resources through a rich portfolio of highly
        diversified asset classes and active investment management
        strategies, targeting positive capital returns. Investment
        mandates implemented included global and regional
        Public and Private Equities, global Mainstream Hedge Fund 
        strategies and global real estate and infrastructure. The
        Council has managed to grow through sound and prudent
        investment strategies in spite of challenging market
        conditions. Since its inception, The Council has entered into
        a number of well-planned international investments that
        enriched its portfolio, leading the organisation towards its
        ambitious goals, including the purchase of a strategic stake
        in the renowned Chrysler Building in New York.</p>
        	
        <p>Although the Council invests globally, there is a strong
        focus on investing in the local economy in line with Abu
        Dhabi’s 2030 vision of building a diversified economy. Some
        of its significant investments include substantial stakes
        in prominent organizations such as the National Bank of
        Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union National
        Bank, Al Hilal Bank, Abu Dhabi National Insurance Company,
        Abu Dhabi Aviation Company and Abu Dhabi Investment
        Company (Invest AD).</p>

        By creating an environment which is both disciplined and
        innovative, The Council aims to become one of the world’s
        foremost effective and efficient investment institutions,
        capable of managing assets and generating high and
        consistent returns over the long-term, while sustaining

        <p>National Holding (NH) originated in 1999 when Emirates
        International Investments Company (EIIC), the parent
        company of the group, was established in the emirate of
        Abu Dhabi. Within the last five years, NH has strengthened
        its position as a Highflyer after successive investments in
        the international arena. These investments were made by
        the five diversified companies that are operating under the
        umbrella of the holding company: EIIC, Bloom Properties,
        Exceed Industries, Rise General Trading and Petromal.</p>
        <p>EIIC is the investment arm and the parent company of
        the group. As a result of its continuing hunt for strategic
        investment opportunities, the company currently holds
        active investments across a wide range of asset classes. In
        2007, it acquired significant shares in Abu Dhabi Islamic
        Bank (ADIB). In conjunction with the bank, it went abroad by
        acquiring a majority stake of National Bank for Development
        in Egypt, an acquisition that has given the group a stronger
        presence in the MENA region. In addition, EIIC holds longterm
        strategic investments in regional and global companies
        including the French multinational mass media and
        telecommunication company Vivendi.</p>
        <p>NH moved to property sector in 2001. It rebranded its real
        estate department by launching Bloom Properties in 2008
        with a focus of creating thriving master-planned communities
        in major cities across the region and beyond. Locally, Bloom
        manages 30 residential and commercial towers in addition
        to several retail centre and residential compounds. On the
        international arena, it holds properties in Algeria.</p>

        <p>To further enhance its standing and competitive position
        in local, regional and global markets by identifying and
        responding to strategic investment opportunities, NH stepped 
        into the industrial sector in 2002. A diversified
        manufacturing industrial company Exeed Industries was
        established as the industrial arm of the group. It consists
        of fifteen entities spanning building materials and fibers,
        agriculture business and international investments. Exeed
        has a strong presence in Algeria, owing a copper and
        aluminum-cables factory Cablet El Djazair. In addition, Exeed
        owns National Integrated Industries Complex in Jordan,
        manufacturing a range of electronic home appliances with
        a target on South Africa, Eastern Europe-CIS, and the Iran
        markets.</p>
        <p>RISE General Trading, the trading arm of the group, is
        divided into engineering services, project management,
        consulting, and national travel and tourism services. RISE is
        operating locally and plans to expand its reach to the MENA
        region.</p>

       <p> National Holding has recently launched an oil and gas
        company Petromal which is now divided into four distinct
        business units: Upstream (oil and gas producing assets),
        Downstream (refining and petrochemicals), Petroleum
        Services (oil field services and engineering & fabrication) and
        Minerals. Since inception, the company formed two joint
        ventures with the UK’s Premier Oil. It has also partnered with
        Egyptian Mud Engineering Chemicals (EMEC) to form EMEC
        E (Emirates), a partnership that marks the company’s entry
        into the oil field services market. . The Joint Venture covers
        the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen.</p>
        <p>Through establishing diversified companies, the group
        has successfully left its footmarks on multiple sectors and
        across a wider area, efficiently making the group as one of
        the UAE-based international highflyer.</p>

   <b>Developing an environmental project in Algeria</b>
        
<p>Bloom Properties, the real estate arm of
National Holding, has taken the decision
of developing a USD 5 billion urban park
in Algeria called “Dounya Parc”. The
project’s area is 6.6 million square meter,
with 25% dedicated to high quality
commercial and residential development.
With a focus of enhancing the natural
environment, attractions like equestrian
centre, golf course, playgrounds, nature
and hiking trails and vista points are
included in the park. In addition, one
million trees as well as themed parks will
be planed, surrounding the real estate
multi-functional complex. This strategic
investment opens hundreds of job
opportunities as well as attracts tourists
from around the world, contributing to the
growth of the tourism sector in Algeria.</p>

        personalised approach to its advisory and discretionary
        services, tailoring each step to the investors’ needs
        and wishes. ADIH services include private equity, asset
        management and corporate finance.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure productive results, the company’s
        approach was designed to balance assets with innovation,
        while paying attention to risk factors and fundamental
        analysis.</p>
	
        <p>In addition, the services business model focuses on
        funds, wealth and portfolio management as well as risk
        management and advisory services, offering high-net-worth 
        individuals and institutional investors access to a full range of
        investment avenues.</p>
        <p>In practice, this translates into originating and structuring
        deals in corporate and real estate investments, structure
        funds, arranging external funding, engineering profitable
        exits from investments and ensuring tax-efficient deals.</p>
        <p>To make opportunities both appealing and viable to its
        investors, ADIH came up with unique investment concepts
        for its international expansion. The firm currently markets
        two concepts in several countries around the world, namely
        Entertainment City and Porta Moda.</p>
        <p>Entertainment City is a model of a mixed-use development
        with integrated entertainment components as its investment
        focus, which the company is promoting at a global level.
        The model is designed using private equity and real estate
        investment vehicles, with the advice of international leaders
        in the entertainment industry, to offer investors focus on
        the diverse aspects of the creation and the enjoyment of the
        entertainment industry. ADIH’s Entertainment City concept
        is currently being applied in Qatar and India.</p>
        <p>Porta Moda, on the other hand, is another mixeduse
        development concept, but it comprises residential,
        hospitality, educational and retail components focusing on
        fashion and style. The City features a grand fashion district
        containing premium and luxury brands in the fashion,
        jewellery and interior design fields. The educational district
        will be offering courses and degrees in the arts, as well as a 
        leisure district complete with museums and exhibition
        centres. Downtown is enlivened by townhouses, studios,
        luxury villas, cafes, restaurants and renowned boutique
        hotels and spas.</p>
        
         <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/adih-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Currently, ADIH is building Porta Moda developments
    in Marrakesh, Morocco, and has future plans in Abu Dhabi,
    Doha, India, Tunisia and China. In addition, ADIH has similar
    developments in Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon and Jordan,
    among other countries.
    <p>With such ambitious plans, there is more to come.
    ADIH’s real estate and investment portfolio now includes
    developments throughout the GCC, from Qatar’s USD 3
    billion Entertainment City to a USD 100 million stake in the
    Sunset Hills in Bahrain, to Beirut Gate and Saudi funds.</p>
    <p>The expansion continues with slightly over USD 845
    million to develop the Gulf German Residences in Germany.
    The company also moved to open new offices in Bahrain and
    Geneva to facilitate the pursuit of global opportunities.</p>
    <p>The latest addition to ADIH’s portfolio is the June 2010
    announcement of the company’s first healthcare initiative,
    Wellpharma I.V. Solutions fund, with the objective of
    financing the development of an intravenous (I.V.) solutions
    production and distribution facility within the Industrial City
    of Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi Investment House was named ‘Fastest Growing
    Company of the year’ in 2009, and Qatar Entertainment City
    was crowned the ‘Best Development in Qatar in 2008.</p>

        <p>The UAE trade policy offers a supportive and
        conscientious framework for business and commerce
        to thrive. The country’s leadership has been successful in
        incorporating regulations on par with international standards,
        with regard to economy, trade and investment. Moreover,
        there has been consistent move towards the upgrading
        several major legislations, which have continued to open up
        the way for greater mobility of trade opportunities with the
        rest of the world.</p>
        <p>Under this climate, Dubai Investments (DI) has grown from
        strength to strength, consolidating extremely profitable
        business prospects within the country, and across the Middle
        East region. Since its inception in 1995, DI has established
        companies encompassing a diverse range of sectors. Besides
        its focus on identifying and securing attractive industrial
        and investment opportunities in the UAE and the Gulf, DI
        also recognises existing businesses that have potential, but
        require capital to expand. In such instances, DI contributes
        the requisite assets, thereby becoming a joint venture
        partner and becoming a conduit for ambitious goals.</p>
        <p>DI has over the years encompassed a diverse portfolio
        of companies through its combination of a sound business
        model and experienced leadership. This unshakable
        foundation has enabled DI to prosper and remain resilient
        in the face of global economic challenges and uncertainties.</p>
        <p>Along the years, DI has made several inroads to
        prospective international markets through its subsidiaries,
        winning projects and significant product orders in these
        regions. Alternatively, it has also partnered with many
        international entities in joint ventures, holding major stakes
        in companies across sectors such as banking, Islamic finance,
        telecommunications and property investment.</p>

    <p>Some of the wholly-owned subsidiaries under DI with

    Lumiglass LLC, Globalpharma, Dubai Cranes, Emirates
    Building Systems, Emirates Extrusion Factory, International
    Rubber Company, Gulf Dynamic Switchgear, Gulf Metal Craft,
    Labtech and Litetech Industries, among others.</p>
    Several of its subsidiaries have registered exceptional
    <p>achievements at the international level. Prominent among
    these is Emirates Glass LLC EGL), which won orders worth AED
    20 million in Turkey for projects that require the installation
    on self-cleaning glass. Further on, Emirates Building Systems,
    a regional pioneer in the design, fabrication and construction
    of steel structures, is currently delivering on key overseas
    projects including the Muscat International Airport Main
    Contract 2 expansion plan; a warehouse compound for
    the World Food Programme in Bossaso, Somalia; and a
    warehouse project for Gulf Warehousing Company (GWC) in
    Qatar.</p>
    <p>Lumiglass Industries, another key entity under Glass LLC,
    DI’s glass holding, received the official standards certification
    from the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) for
    its improved bullet-resistant (armour) product line. It was a
    major test of its reliability, which it passes with flying colours,
    as the testing was conducted in Jordan under the strictest
    conditions and in conjunction with a special division under
    the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF).</p>

    <p>The DI approach has been to progressively build-up
    an extensive network of stakeholders in the corporate
    business and investment communities, developing longterm
    mutually respected relationships. It further strengthens
    these bonds within key sectors of business and industry as
    well as surrounding communities.</p>

    wholly by the group and provides it close proximity to a large
    number of subsidiaries based within. For close to two decades,

    to achieve and make a difference have reflected in its solid
    performance and growth, becoming one of the most credible
    public joint stock companies in the region and a world class conglomerate.</p>
    <p>All of these initiatives and achievements have made
    Dubai Investments (DI) a name to be reckoned with amongst
    companies with a proven track record of secure and profitable
    investments within the UAE and Middle East region. Presently,
    DI is the largest investment company listed on the Dubai

    ‘firsts’ in the region, including in the glass, pharmaceutical
    and metal fabrication sectors. As the world increasingly seeks
    prudent financial growth, DI is uniquely positioned in the
    region as a company which upholds the values of foresighted
    investments that lead to collective progress.</p>

        towards positioning the UAE as a major global manufacturing hub. With an eye on consolidating its presence in
        the glass manufacturing & processing sector, the conglomerate set up Glass LLC, the first glass holding company
        in the region.</p>
        <p>One of the major accomplishments in this field came in the year 2012 when Emirates Glass LLC (EGL), one of the
        region’s leading processors of premium architectural flat glass products and a subsidiary of Glass LLC, received
        AED 20 million worth of orders in Turkey for projects that require the installation of self-cleaning glass.</p>
        <p>As part of this partnership with Feryapi, one of the major property investment and development companies in
        Turkey, EGL will supply its products to a portfolio of prestigious projects that will shape the urban map of the
        country. The projects include I-Tower, East and West developments, HAMP, Gold Tower, Nida Tower, and Gursan.
        Equally important is the delivery deadline of the last quarter of 2012 set by EGL, thereby confirming its capacity
        to meet significantly large glass requirements within a short period of time.</p>

        <p>The United Arab Emirates, a nation that is rated as one
        of the world’s top emerging markets, plays a significant
        role in the region’s incredible rate of economic growth. In
        the aftermath of the global financial crisis and resultant
        economic downturn, several UAE-based companies have
        tapped investment opportunities in the MEA and beyond by
        focusing on diversified portfolios.</p>
        <p>As an investment company initially focused on real estate
        and financial services, Emirates Investments Group (EIG) has
        made a name by sourcing unique business opportunities in
        the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. Over a period just a
        decade, its investment portfolio has expanded to include the
        thriving fields of trading, industry and aviation.</p>
        <p>Established in the year 2003, the group now has leading
        names under its portfolio across the sectors that it has a
        presence in. The group was able to benefit substantially
        based on the incredible rate of economic and infrastructural
        growth in the UAE. In addition, its well-planned business
        focus enabled it to diversify its investment to better cope
        with rapidly changing global financial outlooks.</p>

        <p>Leading its real estate portfolio is ENSHAA, a Private
        Joint Stock Company formed in collaboration with Majid
        Al Futtaim Group and Abraaj Capital that specialises in
        development, master planning and delivery of commercial,
        residential and hospitality projects. ENSHAA currently
        operates in the Middle East and is expanding into Asian markets, 
        including China and India. The company has formed
        a number of successful joint venture partnerships with
        prestigious local and foreign companies, and its portfolio
        includes Palazzo Versace Dubai, D1 residential tower and
        Emirates Financial Towers.</p>
        <p>ENSHAA is also the majority shareholder of Dubai-based
        Kele Contracting LLC, regional contractors specialising in
        high-rise construction, and is the owner of Signature Clubs,
        the developers of a growing list of Capital Clubs in Dubai,
        Bahrain and East Africa.</p>
        <p>EIG’s investments in both banking and financial services
        institutions have seen the formation of Emirates Global
        Islamic Bank (EGIB) – Pakistan, Trust Securities and
        Brokerage Limited (TSBL) – Pakistan and Takaful Pakistan
        Limited (TPL). EGIB is one of its key success stories as the
        bank became a fully profitable venture within just 18 months
        of starting operations. Furthermore, in October 2010, it
        successfully merged with the Pakistan operations of a major
        Islamic international bank, thus reinforcing the success of
        EIG’s investment in this promising company.</p>
        <p>Further diversifying its portfolio, EIG formed the Empire
        Aviation Group (EAG), a general aviation company based
        in Dubai in June 2007. Since launch, the company has been
        appointed a GCC regional distributor for Hawker Beechcraft
        and has successfully built an aircraft sales pipeline, which 
        included a sale of five aircraft, and has also formed a joint
        venture presence in India.</p>

        <p>The group’s trading division comprises Emirates
        International Trading Group – an agricultural commodities
        and building materials trading firm and Gulf Natural Supply
        - a joint venture with Australia-based sandalwood specialist
        TFS Corporation. The latter provides sales and distribution
        of this luxury ingredient in the Middle East, North Africa and
        Pakistan through access to the world’s largest resources of
        sustainable, ethical sandalwood.</p>
       <p> Growing in a socially-responsible manner, the group
        has also taken a lead in the Arab World Social Innovators
        Programme as a member of Synergos, a non-profit
        organisation that brings together influential people and
        institutions globally. The programme currently supports 22
        Arab innovators and community leaders.</p>
        <p>Emirates Investments Group (EIG) continues to play a
        significant role in making the most of the viable investment
        opportunities in the UAE and surrounding regions through its
        well-established reputation, available network and influential
        presence. It is a name driven by the vision to be the leading
        investment group of choice based on profitable, ethical
        and socially-responsible business practices, strengthening
        its mission by working closely with established companies
        through partnerships.</p>

   <b>Steering a high-flying success in India</b>
        
    <p>EIG entered the highly challenging field of aviation in the year 2007 through the
    Empire Aviation Group (EAG). This company was founded in response to the
    opportunity of the Middle East regional market for business aviation services as
    well as to manage the aviation assets and interests of EIG.</p>
   <p> Led by an experienced management team, EAG successfully made quick forays
    into related fields including aircraft sales, aircraft charter, air ambulance services,
    aircraft management, aircraft financing & insurance, online hotel bookings and
    bespoke luxury travel packages. Its online hotel booking complements its air
    charter services with a database of over 78,000 hotels in 76 countries.</p>
    <p>Recognising the growth of private air travel and aircraft ownership in India, EAG
    founded Empire Aviation (EA) as a new private aviation specialist in the country
    during 2012 offering comprehensive business aviation services for private
    aircraft owners. It took its first business jet under management in the same year
    at HAL Airport in Bangalore, its first location in India.</p>
    <p>Within a few months, the company has made significant new forays and plans
    to have five aircraft under management in India by mid-2013, whilst doubling
    the team over the same period. This growth marked yet another successful
    investment move by EIG in a field that requires strategic, consistent and fastpaced
    innovation.</p>

        <p>When it comes to investments, foresight and
        ambition play a key role in achieving positive
        results. Exemplifying these qualities at every level is Abraaj
        Capital group, a leading private equity manager investing in
        global growth markets. Since inception in 2002, the group
        has raised over USD 7.5 billion across sector and countryspecific
        Funds encompassing private equity and real estate
        investments, and distributed in excess of USD 4 billion to
        investors from over 60 full and partial exits. The group has
        helped accelerate and facilitate the growth of more than 150
        companies in 33 countries across growth markets in sectors
        as diverse as manufacturing, education, retail, aviation, oil
        and gas, financial payments infrastructure, healthcare, and
        agriculture.</p>
        <p>Among its major recent accomplishments is its acquisition
        of Aureos Capital in 2012, which resulted in the creation of
        the world’s largest SME-focused private equity platform
        investing in growth markets in Africa, Asia, Latin America and
        the Middle East. Furthermore, the group has played a role in
        the success of regional champions including Air Arabia, the
        Middle East’s leading low cost carrier, Network International,
        the largest independent payment solutions provider in the
        Middle East and Africa, IHH Healthcare Berhad, one of the
        largest private healthcare groups in growth markets and Al
        Borg Laboratories, the Middle East’s largest privately owned
        medical testing laboratory.</p>

    <p>The Abraaj Capital group is headquartered at the Dubai
    International Financial Center in Dubai, UAE, providing
    it a central location and world class infrastructure with
    high standards of laws and tax efficiency, as the premier
    financial hub in the region. This has enabled it to stay firm
    on its mission is to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns to
    its investors consistently and played an effective role as an 
    agent of economic change.</p> 
    <p>A key differentiator for Abraaj Capital in the private
    equity industry is the Abraaj Sustainability and Stakeholder
    Engagement Track (ASSET). It is driven by a 5+5+5 model,
    representing 5% of net management fee revenue that helps
    finance its initiatives, five days per employee set aside for
    volunteering and 5% of the annual bonus that each employee
    is encouraged to donate.</p>
    <p>Abraaj Capital’s formidable success is in part due to the
    UAE’s progressive trade policy and business environment
    that has played an important role in the growth of the group
    and the success of its partner companies. Multilateral trade
    liberalisation and bilateral/regional trade agreements have
    also made regional expansion possible.</p>
   <p> The company has always set its sights on international
    expansion through a well thought-out global growth
    strategy. In 2008, Abraaj opened offices in Egypt and Turkey,
    expanding its geographic presence in the region organically.
    In 2011, the acquisition of the Kantara Fund from Society
    General and Credit Agricole enabled Abraaj to establish its
    presence in North Africa, with offices in Tunisia and Morocco.
    In that same year, Abraaj opened a Singapore office for its
    operations in Southeast Asia and prepared plans to establish 
    its presence in Africa. In 2012, the acquisition of Aureos
    Capital perfected Abraaj’s global growth strategy. Today,
    Abraaj capital has a presence across almost all of growth
    markets with over 150 investments in 32 countries.</p>

    <p>Some of its other major milestones include the 2004
    investment in Spinneys, a leading supermarket retailer in the
    region; the acquisition of 25% stake in EFG-Hermes Abraaj
    Capital Holdings Limited and the establishment of the Abraaj
    Capital Art Prize, the richest Art Prize in the world.</p>
    <p>Abraaj Capital has set its sights towards harnessing the
    growth potential of growth markets since inception. Its vision
    and leadership have earned it Private Equity International’s
    ‘Best Private Equity Firm in the Middle East’ award six years
    in a row. Arif Naqvi, Abraaj’s Founder and Group CEO, was
    recognised as one of the 50 most influential people globally
    in the private equity industry. These accomplishments,
    among many international awards and recognitions, attest
    to the success of Abraaj Capital at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>Currently, Abraaj Capital is among the world’s 50-biggest
    private equity groups, and invests in the growing MENASA
    region. Abraaj has now set its sights on becoming the leading
    alternative asset management institution in the geographies
    in which it operates.</p>

   <b>Strengthening a global network</b>
        
    <p>In March 2011, Abraaj Capital completed the acquisition of a 49% stake in Network International LLC, the leading
    provider of payment services in the MENA region covering almost half the market in outsourced card management
    and processing.</p>
    <p>This move started showing results in the same year as Network International identified and executed key strategic
    partnerships and acquisitions to enhance its geographic and product reach. One such partnership was realised
    March 2011, between Network International and China UnionPay, which leveraged the growing trade activities
    between China and the UAE, while benefitting over 3000 Chinese companies registered in the UAE and 200000
    Chinese consumers living and working in the UAE. Additionally, Network International has recently secured deals
    and contracts geared towards taking it into new markets including India and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, Network International, buoyed by the robust backing of Abraaj Capital, aims to continue to expand
    its product suite and geographic coverage, both organically and through acquisitions, setting the company on
    track to become the leading payment services provider in growth markets.</p>

        <p>Gulf Capital was founded in 2006 to take advantage of
        private equity opportunities in the Gulf Cooperation
        Council (the GCC) region. Initially capitalized with USD 330
        million of equity from an extensive shareholder base that
        includes some of the region’s most prestigious financial
        institutions, pension funds, family groups and businessmen,
        Gulf Capital was prepared to begin implementing its private
        equity strategy which is to acquire strategic stakes in highly
        profitable and fast growing companies in select industries in
        the Gulf region.</p>
        <p>Gulf Capital has distinguished itself with a control growth
        buy-out investment model. This is widely considered a
        catalyst for change and growth. Within a few months of
        operation, the company became a major shareholder in
        leading companies like Maritime Industrial Services (MIS) –
        sold to Lamprell in 2011 for USD 336 million – Depa United
        Group, Metito Holdings Limited, Gulf Marine Services and
        Ma’arif for Education & Training (Ma’arif), the largest owner
        and operator of private schools in Saudi Arabia.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    
       <p> In 2008, Gulf Capital launched its flagship buyout Fund,
        GC Equity Partners Fund II. Through this fund, it was able to
        secure strategic shares in major companies like TechnoScan,
        one of the largest Diagnostic Imaging services operations
        in Egypt. In 2012, it acquired Sakr Energy Solutions FZCO,
        a provider of temporary power generation solutions across
        the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia. It also acquired
        Reach Group, a leading contract staffing and temporary employee solution provider to government entities in the UAE. The company continued its success by acquiring Med Ray, a leading medical diagnostic Imaging Company in
        Jordan.</p>
        <p>Gulf Capital has been a very active player in the 	acquisitions industry in the region in 2013. On July, it completed 100%
        acquisition in a regional specialty food company, Chef Middle
        East L.L.C. It also invested in majority stake in OCB Oilfield
        Services and secured several finance facilities to further.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
    <p>Due to its outstanding performance in this industry, the
    company has won several awards including “Best Mid-market
    Deal of the Year” at the Private Equity World MENA Awards
    2007 for their investment in Metito, “Best Private Equity”
    Firm in the Middle East at the Banker Middle East Industry
    Awards 2011, 2012 and 2013, Private Equity “Deal of the
    Year 2011” award for the MIS Exit Deal and best “Investment
    Company” in the region at Arabian Business Achievement
    Awards 2012.</p>
    <p>Gulf Capital did not only succeed in securing strategic
    shares in leading companies across the region but also –
    through its Social Responsibility Program – contributed
    socially to the region by supporting Operation Smile UAE by
    offering 120 free corrective surgeries to children born with
    cleft lips and cleft palates in Jordan. It has recently funded
    the education of 100 underprivileged children in Turkey for
    the Academic year 2013.</p>

        <p>MENA Infrastructure, an infrastructure equity investor
        and fund manager focusing on investments in the
        Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region, was
        founded in 2007 in the Dubai International Financial Centre.
        MENA Infrastructure is owned by HSBC, Fajr Capital and
        Waha Capital and currently manages a USD 300 million
        infrastructure fund that has been invested in 4 major
        investments.</p>
       <p> In 2008, the first investment was made by acquiring
        a minority stake in Alexandria International Container
        Terminals SAE (鄭ICT・, Egypt. This acquisition sent clear
        signals of the investor痴 commitment in implementing its
        investment strategy in an efficient manner. Egypt痴 ports
        sector has achieved an average annual cargo growth of
        over 12% since 1996; AICT, a major terminals operator at
        Alexandria Port and El Dekheila Port ・the main commercial
        ports of the country ・is well-positioned to benefit from the
        economic growth of the country. These key factors among
        others are behind the investor痴 selection of investing in AICT
        and in Egypt.</p>

       <p> En route for becoming a premier infrastructure private
        equity fund in the region, MENA Infrastructure has also
        acquired 32.8% of the Omani company United Power
        Company SAOG (UPC) for USD 26.5 million on June 2009
        after a competitive auction process. The selection of UPC
        is in consistence with the investment strategy of the
        investor that relies on investing in emerging markets where
        macroeconomic characteristics are stronger than advanced
        economies.</p>

		
    <p>MENA Infrastructure has boosted its presence in Oman
    and role in the region in May 2013 when it acquired a 20%
    of the share capital of Sohar Power Company SAOG (SPC).
    SPC owns and operates a 585 megawatt power plant and an
    associated 150,000 m³ water desalination plant in the Sohar
    Industrial Port area of Oman.</p>
    <p>Having successfully invested its first generation fund,
    the firm is seeking to raise MENA Infrastructure Fund II,
    targeting USD 500 million in commitments. This will allow
    the firm to leverage its reputation and connectivity, and to
    continue its proven strategy to capitalize on the increasing
    flow of attractive infrastructure opportunities generated by 
    rapid development in the high growth MENAT economies.</p>

   <b>Investing in Saudi Arabia’s energy sector</b>
        
<p>Macroeconomic fundamentals of Saudi Arabia are
positioning the country among the investment
destinations in the world. These characteristics are
consistent with the investment strategy of MENA
Infrastructure that did not rethink of acquiring a 15%
equity stake in the 4,000MW gas-fired Qurayyah
Independent Power Project (QIPP). QIPP is currently
being developed in Saudi Arabia in partnership with
ACWA Power and Samsung C&T. </p>
<p>In June 2011, MENA Infrastructure Fund was part of
the winning ACWA Power led consortium that was
announced preferred bidder for the development of
the project. The project will deliver almost 4,000 MW
of electricity to Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) under
a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) commencing on 30 June 2014. Samsung C&T is the EPC contractor.
The twelve gas turbines are provided by Siemens. When complete, Qurayyah IPP will be the largest combined
cycle gas-fired power plant in the world.</p>
<p>MENA Infrastructure also invested in a heavy fuel oil power plant “Rabigh IPP 2” 175km north of Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia. The plant is the fourth project in SEC’s IPP program and is projected to have the capacity to produce
1,813MW.</p>

        <p>The Arab world has a significant number of family
        businesses that have evolved into the modern times
        as multinational groups making a significant global imprint.
        In the UAE, the highly advanced trade policies as well as
        friendly ties with national around the world have enabled
        family-owned businesses to thrive beyond the borders.
        These factors have played a crucial role on the operation
        and growth of Thani Investments, a large privately-owned
        business house from the UAE.</p>
      <p>  The group, from its headquarters in Dubai, has expanded
        into more than ten countries within just over a decade
        through four diversified business units. These are oil & gas,
        property development, mining & mineral resources and
        commercial trading & investment.</p>
      <p>  Thani’s emphasis on building long-term growth and
        profits through developing relationships in the Middle East
        have paid rich dividends. Initially, it was primarily focused
        on commercial trading and property development sectors.
        However, in response to the changing dynamics of the global
        economy and to re-balance risk across its portfolio, the
        group subsequently ventured into the oil & gas and mineral
        resources sectors through wholly-owned subsidiaries.</p>

      <p>  Thani Emirates Petroleum, the first independent Arab oil &
        gas company to successfully venture overseas, is engaged in
        the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. It
        has built alliances with global technical partners in pursuing
        enhanced oil & gas development projects. These partners
        include CNPC, Petronas, Sinopec, OMV, PetroVietnam,
        Anadako Petroleum, Tullow Petroleum, Itochu Corporation
        and Sojitz Corporation. Its interests span Sudan, Mauritania,
        Tunisia, Algeria and Senegal. The company is also exploring
        in the emerging markets of Yemen, Libya and Indonesia.</p>

        <p>Thani Emirates Resource Holdings Limited (TERH),
        the first independent Arab junior resource company, is
        mandated to develop, through discovery and acquisition, a
        geographically-diversified, predominantly gold portfolio.
        It currently owns significant mining concessions in Egypt,
        Eritrea, Yemen and Pakistan, and has formed an equal
        stake, strategic alliance with AngloGold Ashanti Limited
        (AngloGold) to explore, develop and operate gold, precious
        and base metals mines across the MENA region.</p>
      <p>  BENAA, the group’s property development and real estate
        business, holds interests in both completed developments
        and ongoing development sites in the commercial, retail,
        hospitality, leisure and residential sectors. It has proposed
        development projects in respect of 85 million sq. ft. of
        developable land. In particular, the company is the lead
        partner in a joint venture with the Al Oula Group, one of the
        largest property developers in the KSA, to deliver Dubai Golf
        City in Dubailand. The project comprises 55 million sq. ft. of
        developable land with a potential completed value in excess
        of AED 20 billion. Its other investments include Al Bustan
        Centre and Residence, Arabian Heights and the Dubai
        Wholesale Plaza.</p>

    <p>Thani Commercial Ventures, its commercial trading
    business has diverse commercial and agency interests
    ranging from shipping, electrical & power and equities
    trading. Its shipping activities include acting as commercial
    agent in Qatar, Oman and Kuwait for over US$ 2 billion of
    VLCC and LNG vessel sales by Mitsui & Co. and Hyundai
    Heavy Industries. It has also supplied approximately 4,000
    km of medium voltage cabling, partnered with BSES Ltd.
    for a major GIS substation project and supported ABB in its
    marketing initiatives.</p>
  <p>  Thani’s vision is one of building long-term differentiated
    businesses which capitalise on their skills and enhance their
    leadership position. This unique value-based proposition
    was evidenced in 2007, when Thani Investments became
    one of the first privately-owned companies in the GCC to
    successfully issue a US$100 million Musharaka Sukuk. Its
    pioneering role brought Thani the ‘Best Sukuk Structure by
    a Private Corporate Issuer’ recognition at the London Sukuk
    Summit in 2008. Founded on the values of integrity, passion
    and energy, Thani currently has over 1,000 employees
    working to build a long-term growth story for Dubai and the
    nation.</p>

   <b>Linking up for success in the MENA region</b>
        
    <p>Thani Emirates Resource Holdings Limited (TERH) is the mineral resources business of the Thani Group, was
    established over 25 years ago to focus on the lucrative markets of precious metals, uranium and rare earth
    minerals. With extensive knowledge developing businesses in the Middle East and Africa, TERH has over the years
    established long-standing relationships with national governments and major industry players.</p>
    <p>One such key alliance came in the year 2019 when TERH formed a joint venture with AngloGold Ashanti (AngloGold),
    a renowned name in the field with operation across four continents. This partnership was a significant move
    towards identifying new opportunities across the MENA region as it combined AngloGold’s global expertise and
    TERH’s regional experience. This ‘Thani Ashanti strategic alliance’ moved rapidly and by 2011 announced several
    joint venture projects at various stages of the exploration process in countries including Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
    Djibouti and Saudi Arabia.</p>
    <p>At present, its world-class exploration concepts and technologies continue to identify opportunities and initiate
