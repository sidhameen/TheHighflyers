        <p>In a region that grows at exceptional pace backed by
massive infrastructure investments, Emaar Properties
stands tall as the developer of world-class masterplanned
communities. A Dubai-based Public Joint Stock Company,
which is listed on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM), Emaar
is not just a regional success story, but a globally-renowned
property developer and provider of premier lifestyles.</p>
<p>Emaar, the developer of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest
building, and other iconic real estate assets, has been shaping
landscapes and lives in the UAE since the company’s inception
in 1997. Extending its expertise in developing master-planned
communities internationally, today, it has a significant
presence in several key global markets. Simultaneously, the
company has developed competencies in hospitality, leisure,
shopping malls and retail.</p>
<p>Emaar has numerous real estate projects in its primary
market of Dubai including established communities and
developments in various stages of completion. Key among
these is the integrated lifestyle destination Downtown
Dubai, which is the world’s most visited lifestyle destination
and is planned to include The Opera District. The established
communities of Emaar include Dubai Marina, Arabian
Ranches and Emirates Living, which comprises Emirates Hills,
The Meadows, The Springs, The Greens, The Lakes and The Views,
preferred by its cosmopolitan residents for their elite
lifestyles.</p>

	<div id="co_img">

    </div><!-- co_img -->


<p>Emaar is also partnering in implementing Mohammed
Bin Rashid City, a new city within Dubai, and with Dubai
Holding has unveiled Dubai Hills, the first project in the
master-development. Leveraging the robust growth of
Dubai’s economy and the strong investor confidence in the
company’s commitment to delivery and world-class project
development, Emaar launched The Address Residence Sky
View, The Address The BLVD, and The Address Residence
Fountain Views. Some of the other new project launches
by Emaar include Panorama at The Views and CASA an
architecturally-stunning Moroccan style villa community as
part of Emaar’s extension of Arabian Ranches.</p>
	
<p>The developer is renowned globally for landmarks that
include Burj Khalifa, The Dubai Mall and The Dubai Fountain
– all set in Downtown Dubai, described as ‘The Centre of
Now,’-and also featuring The Address Downtown Dubai, The
Palace Downtown Dubai, The Address Dubai Mall and Souk
Al Bahar. Downtown Dubai is also home to one of the world’s finest
 boulevards, the spectacular Mohammed Bin Rashid
Boulevard.</p>
<p>Globally, Emaar has a collective presence in several
markets spanning the Middle East, North Africa, Pan-Asia,
Europe and North America. It has highlighted its commitment
to project delivery by handing over homes in its masterplanned
communities in Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan and Canada, and commercial
offices in Syria.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Emaar’s international projects in Egypt include: Marassi,
Mivida and Cairo Gate as well as a ‘city within a city’
development, Emaar Square, at its flagship Uptown Cairo
in 2012. Making a mark in the MENA region as a premium
developer, it has established a presence in several other
countries. Emaar’s other developments around the region
include Amelkis, Saphira and Tinja in Morocco; Samarah Dead
Sea Resort in Jordan; The Eighth Gate project in Damascus,
Syria; Emaar Square in Turkey and Beit Misk in Lebanon. In
Saudi Arabia, Emaar is developing King Abdullah Economic
City, a mixed-use project located on the Red Sea coast, which
is the largest private sector-led development in the region
and has the potential to create
1 million jobs.</p>
<p>Emaar Middle East, a subsidiary that is focused on
projects in the Middle East, has unveiled several projects
in key growth markets. These include Jeddah Gate, a masterplanned
mixed-use project in Jeddah’s new downtown; Al Khobar Lakes, a luxury
lakefront development; and Emaar Residences at Makkah Clock Tower.</p>
<p>As part of its strategic partnerships, Emaar has
joined hands with The Turner Corporation, the USA’s 
leading building services provider, to form Turner International
Middle East Ltd to jointly tap regional growth opportunities.
In 2011, Emaar launched a wholly-owned subsidiary, Dawahi
Development, envisaged as the next-generation pan-Arab
developer of ‘value housing’ projects within full-service
community developments.</p>
<p>Beyond the region, in India, the company also has Boulder
Hills, a world-class leisure and residential community in
Hyderabad; the Commonwealth Games Village in Delhi;
Mohali Hills in Punjab and The Palm Springs and The Palm
Drive in Gurgaon, to its name in India. Emaar has also
pioneered the development of master-planned communities
in Pakistan with Canyon Views in Islamabad, and Crescent
Bay in Karachi, Pakistan, and has handed over the first homes
in Canyon Views.</p>

    <img src="images/emaar-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Emaar has also made extensive forays in the global
hospitality and leisure sector with The Address Hotels +
Resorts, the group’s 5-star premium hotel brand, signing
management agreements to operate The Address Masai
Mara in Kenya and The Address Marassi Golf Resort and Spa
in Marassi, Egypt, as well as in Emaar Square, Turkey.</p>
<p>Emaar Properties recorded full-year 2012 net profit of US$
577 million and a total revenue of US$ 2.243 billion, highlighting
the company’s strong financial fundamentals. Reinforcing the
success of the company’s focus on strengthening its recurring
revenue streams, Emaar’s shopping malls, retail, hospitality
and leisure businesses contributed US$ 1.115 billion to the
full-year revenue in 2012. While the contribution of Emaar’s
international operations to the total revenue was US$ 344
million, representing 15 percent of the total revenue.</p>
<p>Marking the clear differentials that Emaar brings to 
property and lifestyle development, the company holds five
Guinness World Records: The Tallest Building and Tallest Manmade
Structure Ever for Burj Khalifa; Largest Shopping Centre
for The Dubai Mall; the Highest Restaurant from Ground
Level for At.mosphere; and the Single Largest Acrylic Viewing
Panel for Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo. True to its
stature, the company has won several local and international
accolades, commending its inimitable achievements across
the property and lifestyle development spectrum. </p>

   <b>Redefining luxury hospitality with Armani brand</b>
<p>Over the years, Emaar’s hospitality division has successfully
developed several successful brands such as The Address Hotels
+ Resorts, which includes in its portfolio, exclusive hotels, resorts
and serviced residences.</p>
<p>Aside from these, it brought to the world a unique combination of
luxury lifestyle developments by teaming up with the legendary
fashion brand, Giorgio Armani S.p.A, to build and manage Armani
Hotels and Resorts across the world. This partnership led to the
opening of the world’s first Armani Hotel and Armani Residences
in Emaar’s flagship Burj Khalifa, a destination that truly matches
the brand’s essence of original style.</p>
<p>Taking the success forward, the company opened Armani Hotel
Milano, Italy, in 2011. Located in the world famous couture district,
known as Quadrilatero Della Moda, this five-star property is only
a few minutes away from the luxury shopping streets as well
as the famous La Scala theatre and the spectacular Piazza del
Duomo. Emaar plans to expand its reach in luxury hospitality
with a presence in the world’s most vibrant metropolises in the
near future. Showcasing its hospitality division’s success, the
brand scooped top votes for the ‘World’s Leading Hospitality
Development Company’ at the World Travel Awards (WTA) 2012.</p>

   <b>A new name for luxury in Turkey</b>
        
<p>Working on a strategic expansion plan by moving into promising markets in the region, Emaar Turkey, a subsidiary
of Emaar Properties PJSC is bringing a new lifestyle to the country with its masterplanned communities. Emaar
Turkey started with the first gated community project, Tuscan Valley Houses. Inspired by the Tuscan architectural
style, and enriched with magnificent views of Büyükçekmece Lake and Marmara Sea, it includes 540 luxury units
including villas, apartments and townhouse. Emaar moved at a rapid pace and upon the successful handing over
of homes in the first phase, announced the second phase, which features villas, villa suites and apartments.</p>
<p>In addition to Tuscan Valley, Emaar Turkey announced
the Emaar Square, another integrated community with
1,000 luxury homes; The Address Hotel, a five-star
premium property; and a shopping mall, envisaged as
one of the largest in Turkey. Defining a new benchmark
in Turkey, The Address Residence Emaar Square, will
feature exclusive serviced residences.</p>
<p>These accomplishments have brought the company
several laurels, key among which is the ‘Best Developer’
of residential and mixed-use projects in the UAE and
Turkey, aside from the ‘Best Developer in the Middle
East and North Africa’ at the 2010 Euromoney Real
Estate Awards.</p>

        <p>In the midst of beginning a new dawn for a young country,
        Arabtec was founded to contribute to the architectural
        renascence in the early 1970s. From building three cold
        stores in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Muscat and student
        accommodations in Al Ain to the construction of the world’s
        tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, and the iconic seven-star
        hotel, Burj Al Arab, Arabtec’s success has indeed gone
        beyond imagination.</p>
        <p>Today, Arabtec specializes in construction projects that
        include high-rise developments, hotel interiors, residential
        complexes, office blocks, commercial and industrial projects,
        major airport developments, stadiums, drainage, sewage
        Treatment Plants, offshore oil and gas installations, cinemas,
        entertainment facilities, communities, and luxury villas. The
        company has grown across different sectors and geographic
        markets.</p>
        <p>The 1980s period did not only witness the accomplishment
        of a number of residential and commercial projects in the
        local market but it also saw the company’s expansion into a
        new segment and commencement of forming a client base.
        In 1984, Arabtec delivered its first turn-key project that
        involved both construction and design “The Abu Ghazaleh
        Building” in Sharjah. It has also won numerous contracts to
        construct automobile distribution centers, commercial and
        residential building for Al Futtaim Group. In addition, the 
        long involvement with the oil and gas sector commenced in
        1980s when Arabtec began executing a residential and office
        development on Mubarraz Island, laboratories and control
        centers, jetty projects and the West Mubarraz oil and gas
        processing plant for Abu Dhabi Oil Co. (Japan) Ltd. (ADOC).</p>

    <img src="images/arabtec-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
        <p>The company’s meticulous selection of partners is one
        the important factors that secured its well-standing position
        through the depression that marked the construction market
        in the late 1980’s when it engaged a Swiss company, Cablex,
        to assist it in a number of 132KV oil-filled cable installations
        for Dubai Electricity and Water Authority with a collective
        value in excess of USD 16.3 million. These projects carried
        Arabtec safely through the tough period.</p>
        <p>By the 1990, Arabtec’s name became synonymous with
        class, excellence and superiority. The company began
        exploring different horizons, making its marks on the
        aviation world - the Emirates New Technical Centre and the
        expansion of Dubai Airport - that played a key role in the
        company’s rise to the top of the construction field in the UAE.</p>
       <p> Arabtec continued to play a major role in redefining
        the skyline of Dubai. In conjunction with Samsung and Six
        Construct, it was involved in the construction of the world’s
        tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, which stands 828 metres
        tall. Nearby, the Burj Lake Hotel, now called the Address
        Hotel, has recently been completed, in a joint venture with
        Six Construct. This earned recognition in the world as The
        New Hotel of 2008. Recently, Tourism Development and
        Investment Company (TDIC), a master developer of major
        tourism, cultural and residential destinations in Abu Dhabi,
        has awarded the construction of the Louvre Abu Dhabi, set
        to open in the Saadiyat Cultural District in 2015, to Arabtecled
        joint venture with Constructora San Jose SA and Oger.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
        <img src="images/arabtec-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
        </div><!-- co_img -->
        
        <p>Arabtec’s commitment towards becoming a leading
        provider of quality construction and engineering services
        locally, regionally and globally has driven it to successfully
        expand its geographic footprint. Al Waab City in Qatar,
        Lamar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and Karachi Financial Towers
        in Pakistan are a few examples of Arabtec’s completed
        projects in the neighboring countries. In 2011, Arabtec and
        Combined Group Company PLC Joint Venture were awarded
        to build University Colleges in Kuwait, a contract valued at
        USD 408 million.</p>
        <p>Globally, Arabtec has gone through a stiff competition to
        win the bid of Okhta Centre project, with a contract value
        of USD 2.7 billion, over European and Russian contractors.
        Due to its extensive experience in building quality projects
        and its successful record of implementation of similar
        projects, Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russia’s national gas
        economy and St. Petersburg’s mayor office were convinced
        to award Arabtec this iconic contract. The project comprises
        a 400-metre high tower having the shape of a flame that
        resembles the logo of Gazprom; three podium buildings as
        well as massive underground structures and special external
        works.</p>
        <p>With a portfolio that contains varied high standard eyecatching
        projects like Burj Al Arab, Sky Gardens Tower, Al
        Fattan Marine Towers, Tiara United Towers, The Infinity Tower,
        Ocean Heights, Lamar Towers, Nation Towers, Silverene Twin
        Towers and the prestigious Burj Khalifa, a workforce of over
        70,000 employees worldwide and state-of-the-art plant and
        equipment, a well-established and firm senior management
        team that has been dynamically dedicated to the company
        through the years, Arabtec can unquestionably win any
        competition in the realm of construction. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Al Maabar’s forward thinking commitment
to social, environmental and economic responsibility has
not only made the company a welcomed partner in partner
countries, but has also resulted in driving the company’s
leadership position in MENA’s mixed-used real estate
development market. Meanwhile, its shareholders’ support
ensures long-term investment sustainability and access to
the extensive combined experiences of its shareholders,
positions Al Maabar as an attractive partner that is wellpositioned
for future growth.</p> 

<p>Marsa Zayed, named in memory of the late Sheikh Zayed
bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is Al Maabar’s flagship project in Jordan
and the largest mega mixed-use real estate development
project to take place in the country and the MENA region.
Situated in the historic gateway to the Levant, Marsa Zayed
encompasses 3.2 million square meters of land area in the
heart of Aqaba, including 2 kilometres of newly developed,
prime waterfront property between the coast of the Red Sea
and majestic mountains of Aqaba.</p>
<p>Developed by Al Maabar’s wholly owned subsidiary Aqaba
Real Estate Development Company, Marsa Zayed will feature
high-rise residential and office towers, hotels, retail spaces
and commercial facilities including shopping centres, cafés
and fitness centres. Once completed, Marsa Zayed’s 30,000
residential units, eight hotels with 3,000 rooms and marina
facilities with 300 berths for yachts and boats, will make this
Aqaba downtown property a leading commerce, tourism and
residential attraction in Jordan.</p>
<p>The first project phase includes the award-winning
residential properties of Al Raha Village and the Sheikh
Zayed Masjid. Al Raha Village, received the “Best Mixeduse
Architecture” Award, while the Sheikh Zayed Masjid,
 which takes its architectural inspiration from Abu Dhabi’s
Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, was presented with the “Best
Public Service Architecture” Award at the world-renowned
International Property Awards Arabia 2012. Sales at Al Raha
Village, the first of Marsa Zayed’s properties are expected to
begin in early 2013 and the property is on track for completion
in 2016.</p>

<p>Touting a signature address in the capital’s enviable
Abdoun District, The St. Regis ® Amman and The Residences
at The St. Regis Amman overlooks Jordan’s capital. Being
developed by Al Maabar Abdoun Real Estate Development
Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Al Maabar, the St.
Regis properties carry the world-renowned Starwood brand,
offering a premier lifestyle that will set the standards for
luxury in Jordan. The first St. Regis properties to be launched
in Jordan will showcase two 16-story towers connected by
an external façade. The hotel tower will feature a 260 guest
rooms, including 86 suites and 40 serviced apartments, while
the second tower will feature Jordan’s first private branded
residences. Exclusive boutiques featuring prominent
international brands, along with four restaurants, a signature
spa, fitness centre, a café, pool, business centre and
 ultra-modern meeting rooms are among
the planned amenities.</p>

<p>In Morocco, the new trendy downtown comes to life with
the Bab Al Bahr, an integrated city featuring luxury commercial,
residential, retail, leisure arts and cultural developments. Bab Al Bahr,
which will house 1,700 residential units, sits between the two ancient
cities of Rabat and Salé where Morocco’s Bouregreg River meets
the Atlantic Ocean, overlooking the Hassan Tower, Kasbah des Oudayas
and the Great Mosque of Salé.</p>

    <img src="images/maabar-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>This project was initiated in 2010 by Bab Al Bahr Development
 Company (BBDC), a joint venture between Al Maabar and
the Morocco-based Bouregreg Agency. By 2012, 70 percent
of Bab Al Bahr’s available phase one Marina and River
front residential properties had been sold. An architectural
innovation that reflects the region’s ancient art forms and
Arab-Andalusian lifestyle, Bab Al Bahr is expected to become
an iconic landmark of Rabat, following its completion in 2016.</p>
<p>A combination of commercial, retail, hospitality and
residential units in the heart of the Libyan capital, Al Waha
comprises a 20-story luxury hotel, 23-story office tower
and “market” space with a hypermarket, restaurants and
retail shops that spans across 40,000 square metres. Al
Waha, which has been designed to pay tribute to Libya’s rich
cultural heritage and landscapes, particularly the Oasis town
of Ghadamis,will feature the country’s first Rotana property.</p>
<p>A joint venture development between the Libyan
Investment and Development Company (LIDCO) and Al
Maabar, Al Waha has been a long-time vision of Al Maabar.
Seeing Libya’s significantly untapped market potential
early on, Al Maabar pioneered in the country’s real estate
market, setting the trend for glamorous mixed-use landmark
properties.</p>

   <b>Bab Al Bahr revival through dedicated preservation</b>
        
<p>About 70 percent of the Bouregreg Valley’s
historical landmarks are located within Bab Al Bahr
development site, and as part of its efforts to preserve
and protect these historical landmarks, Al Maabar has
been working closely with local community partners
such as Morocco’s Bouregreg Agency. In order
to achieve this, Al Maabar has assigned a team of
specialist archaeologists to provide their expertise
throughout the project duration, so that Bab Al Bahr
continues to deliver unique cultural returns, economic
and social benefits for the local community.</p>
<p>Being developed as an integrated city that joins the
two ancient cities of Rabat and Salé, Bab Al Bahr will
bring about a Renaissance in the country’s capital,
while increasing pedestrian crossings for the residents,
businesses and visitors of the new community that
continues to flourish every day.</p>
<p>Given the sheer size and scale of Bab Al Bahr (292,000
square metres), which includes seven districts –
Jewel, Cultural, Salé Wall, Arts, Service, Marina and
River front Districts, built around the Central District,
it’s inevitable that this development will become
Morocco’s new trendiest downtown. The country’s
first tramway will offer passengers a delightful tour
of downtown Rabat, which showcases museums,
art galleries, boutiques and the future Rabat Grand
Theatre, which is being designed by Zaha Hadid,
the internationally acclaimed Iraqi architect who
designed The Aquatic Centre to host the 2012 London
Olympics and the Dubai Opera house.</p>

   <b>Creating a positive economic impact in Jordan</b>
        
<p>With the strategic aim to ensure long-term economic and social returns for the local Marsa Zayed community,
Aqaba Real Estate Development Company has been working in close collaboration with the Aqaba Development
Corporation (ADC) and Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA), both responsible for driving Aqaba’s
economic growth.</p>
<p>Marsa Zayed is already supporting the enhancement of the Jordanian economy through job creation, talent
development, knowledge transfer, economic stimulus and foreign exchange gains.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Aqaba Real Estate Development Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Jordan’s
National Company for Employment and Training, the organization overseeing the implementation of the National
Training and Employment Project (NTEP), which supports the efforts of the Ministry of Labour to reduce the
country’s unemployment rate especially among the youth population by providing job training. Upon completion,
the Marsa Zayed development is predicted to generate approximately 15,000 jobs for Jordan.</p>
<p>In 2012, Al Maabar signed a five-year agreement with the Jordan River Foundation (JRF), a non-profit nongovernmental
organisation chaired by Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan with the mission to help Jordanians to realise their full economic potential
and overcome social challenges. To date,
economic development programmes aimed to
stimulate the local economy, while increasing the
involvement of local authorities in development
projects have been implemented, in addition
to those that encourage the development
of Aqaba’s community and increase socioeconomic
empowerment amongst the youth
segment. Significant milestones have already
been reached with more than 500 enrolled
programme participants, including 150 Jordanian
youth.</p>

<p>In late 2011, DAMAC Properties, established ‘DAMAC Suites and Spas’ to
manage the developer’s hotel apartment developments in the premium
Downtown Dubai and to cater to the growing demand of serviced premises.</p>
<p>‘DAMAC Suites and Spas’ will provide a comprehensive list of services for
residents, spanning from state of the art spa treatments, housekeeping,
concierge services, chauffeur driven cars and even private jet and yacht
charter. The positioning is ‘luxury at your service’ where on offer will be
the personalization of every hotel service conveniently in customer’s
apartments. The company will create the total luxury lifestyle experience
for people residing within premium DAMAC developments.</p>
<p>The hospitality management company is an independently run subsidiary of
DAMAC Properties. It will offer services such as housekeeping at the most
basic level, to items such as personalised butler services and personal chef
services at the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The move into hospitality management represents a strategic shift for
DAMAC Properties and follows extensive market research. The company
identified a clear market niche and is seeking to provide a service unlike
anything currently on offer in Dubai.</p>
<p>By 2014, DAMAC Suites and Spas will have over 2000 hotel apartments
under development across the region making DAMAC Properties the
largest developer of services apartments in the territory.</p>

   <b>Rolling out hypermarkets in Pakistan</b>
        
    <p>As the leading retail and leisure pioneer in the MENA region,
    Majid Al Futtaim Group decided to enter the Pakistani retail
    market in 2009, driven by the strong economic fundamentals
    – highly populated emerging market.</p>
    The first mega-store of Al Futtaim Properties was launched
    in the city of Lahore in May 2009. The expansion plan in
    Pakistan moved ahead as planned by establishing a second
    Hyperstar in the country’s commercial capital Karachi in
    2010. The Karachi Hyperstar was built over 8,500 square
    metres and provides 40,000 different types of goods.
    These hypermarkets gave Pakistanis an access to different
    products and commodities they were presented before.</p>
    <p>Within the coming five years, Al Futtaim Properties planned to establish at least seven hypermarkets in Pakistan
    under the brand name “Hyperstar”. Indeed, the presence of the group in Pakistan is enhancing the group’s leading
    role in the Indian Subcontinent region. In addition, thousands of jobs are created.</p>

        <p>The UAE and Dubai, in particular, has always been a
        key regional trading hub. This advantage saw the
        emergence of several family-owned firms founded several
        decades ago. Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal Establishment,
        established in Dubai in the year 1947 is one such family
        business house that was initially a real estate and general
        trading firm. Through a foresighted strategy and buoyed
        by the rapid growth of the nation’s economy, it has today
        emerged as one of the largest, multi-faceted conglomerates
        with an international footprint.</p>
        <p>Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal Establishment has not only
        established a highly reputable company, but has also played
        a major role in the development of the UAE. Right from the
        drilling of wells for meeting the growing water requirements
        to bringing the latest technology in waste management, it
        has always played a pioneering role in creating a diversified
        and sustainable growth.</p>

        <p>In fact, Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal Establishment’s
        visionary approach and clear focus on enriching and
        sustaining the environment of the UAE and the region was
        evident since the start of its journey to success. When Nasser
        Bin Abdullatif Alserkal, the founder of the establishment,
        started his business in 1947, the key driver was the realization
        that the revival and development of the regional of the
        agricultural sector – a key pillar of the economy in many
        parts of the UAE and Oman at the time – was dependent
        on developing new water sources and changing the way
        irrigation systems work. When farmers across the UAE and
        Oman replaced their old-fashioned, bull-based irrigation
        systems with water pumps and water drilling machines
        newly imported by Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal, the impact
        on the production of the farms and on their quality of lives
        was truly phenomenal. Throughout the company history, Bin
        Abdullatif Alserkal Establishment continued to introduce
        entrepreneurial and innovative products and solutions
        directly impacting the lives and well-being of the region’s
        citizen at large.</p>
	
    <p>One of its many contracting firms, Alserkal Environmental
    Engineering is focused on the application of science and
    engineering principles to improve the environment. It has
    formed key strategic alliance with high profile global brands
    to bring the latest technology to the UAE. Its partners include
    Megalab - Canada, ECOLO – Canada and major European
    biotechnology establishments committed to helping solve
    environmental problems.</p>
    
    <p> Whereas, Master Plumber Services (MPS) has an
    outstanding reputation in providing ideal services in
    industrial, commercial and residential cleaning and
    maintenance. Furthermore, the establishment’s oil waste
    treatment division partnered with Dubai Municipality to
    build and operate the first edible oil waste treatment plant
    in the entire region. This facility is equipped with state-ofthe-
    art machinery to handle separation of oil and grease for
    classification as either hazardous material or biodiesel.</p>
    <p>In the field of real estate, the establishment has a presence
    through Alserkal Properties and is presently actively involved
    in leading, developments and maintenance of property. The
    other establishment companies in this sector include Dome,
    a design, construction and marketing firm.</p>

    <p>Nasser Bin Abdullatif Alserkal Establishment occupies a
    place of pride in the automotive sector of the UAE as the sole
    retailer and distributor of Bridgestone tires and accessories.
    Its trading expertise has established Bridgestone as the
    leading tire brand within the region. In Dubai and Northern
    Emirates, it holds approximately 30 percent of the total
    market share and a 45 percent share among all Japanese
    tires in the market. Further on, Tires Agencies Centre is the sole UAE agent of Kumho brand tires, which ranks among
    the world’s top 10 tire brands. The establishment also
    represented Apollo Tires with an aim to bring a wider array of
    products and solutions to the region.</p>
    
    <p>The establishment’s other significant regional
    partnerships include Tata Projects Limited (TPL) - an
    engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company
    and QiTARAT - the first private company to bring new rail
    technologies, products and services into the MENA region.</p>
    <p>Leveraging its real estate expertise acquired in the UAE,
    the establishment has made significant overseas forays in
    the hospitality and leisure sector. It set up Qube, a hospitality
    advisory firm in partnership with two industry specialists.
    The firm presently has its primary offices in Dubai, while
    the operational office is located in Hong Kong. Closer to
    home, the establishment formed Harf Resorts, a real estate
    development company focused on the hospitality sector in
    Oman. It is in the process of developing a luxury boutique
    resort in Musandam, Sultanate of Oman. Creating a presence
    in Jordan, it established Amandla Establishment, an advisory
    firm focused on strategic communications consulting and
    media production.</p>

   <b>Harf resorts: Taking leisure to the next level in Musandam</b>
        
    <p>The cliffs of Musandam in Oman overlooking the Strait of Hormuz
    offer a perfect view and are quite popular among travelers from
    across the world. Identifying a unique opportunity to develop a
    leisure destination, the group launched the Alila Villas Musandam
    as an integrated resort community, designed to offer contemporary
    Omani-inspired living integrated with cultural richness.</p>
    <p>The development, which is soon to be completed, also offers
    the ability to lease residential villas on a long-term basis. It also
    encompasses a five-star hotel with one-bedroom villas, destination
    spa and leisure facilities, managed and maintained by Alila Hotels
    and Resorts - Asia’s leading boutique hotel management company.
    This unique approach by the Alserkal Group of partnering leading
    global names and offering long-term stays has placed this project

        residential and commercial tower developments across five
        nations.</p>
        <p>Deyaar was formed with the aim of capitalising on the
        property boom in the UAE and Dubai, in particular. With a
        view towards building residential and commercial towers that
        accommodate every need and every lifestyle, Deyaar made
        rapid forays into property development and management.
        Aside from being one of the largest developers in Dubai’s
        Business Bay, it also launched ventures that straddle the
        major growth corridors and prime locations of the Emirate.</p>

        <p>Deyaar’s multi-faceted operations are divided across
        four key business units: property development, property
        management, facilities management and association
        management. Through these lines, the company aims
        to maximise investor profits, while continuing to provide
        customers with the highest levels of service in the industry
        and deliver real solutions that truly enhance the value of their
        property investments. Following an Initial Public Offerings in
        May 2007, it attracted massive oversubscription and raised a
        share capital of USD 1.6 billion. As part of its long-term goal
        to become a truly global brand, the firm expanded with a clear strategy to form a steady international presence. </p>
        <p>The company’s property portfolio now includes over
        17,000 residential, commercial and retail units. In the UAE
        alone, Deyaar manages over 820 buildings comprising 17,000
        apartments and offices, with a high overall occupancy rate
        of 95 percent. While Deyaar is one of the largest developers
        at Dubai’s Business Bay, its real estate ventures span
        across major growth corridors and prime locations in Dubai,
        including Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, IMPZ,
        TECOM and Dubai Silicon Oasis. The company’s current
        project portfolio includes iconic residential and commercial
        tower developments.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Sometime in 2005 the Management decided that
        Deyaar should expand internationally and formed strategic
        alliances with major developers in the countries that were
        identified as growth centers. Deyaar expanded to Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the USA to name a few. Deyaar’s
        international footprints cover Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Turkey,
        United Kingdom and United States with impending forays
        into Saudi Arabia, Qatar and India.</p>
        
		<p>As a name that is well-positioned to play a pivotal role
        in the regional property sector, Deyaar follows global best
        practices in every aspect. In line with this commitment,
        the company’s revenue recognition policy is based on the
        recommendations of the International Accounting Standard
        Board (IASB), which recognises revenue based on the
        completed contract method. Moreover, it is also actively
        involved in forging new partnerships with well-established
        international names to take its success further in different
        markets. The company continues to maximise investor
        profits and is now one of Dubai’s largest publicly traded real
        estate companies.</p>

   <b>Gaining a strong foothold in Lebanon</b>
        
    <p>After its successful forays in the UAE, Deyaar Development was actively seeking opportunities to enter and grow
    in new markets and new regions. Within a short period since its inception, it started eyeing regional locations
    for expanding its portfolio of projects. Starting out, it made significant investments in Lebanon and Turkey,
    recognising the high potential of these two destinations. This move was led by its vision to become the leading
    developer of communities in growth markets across the world.</p>
    <p>Lebanon proved to be a considerably challenging market with high property costs and ongoing infrastructural
    development. Nonetheless, the company had a vision of being part of the reconstruction development of the
    Beirut Central District Urban Reconstruction Program by Solidere, the nation’s largest developer. Deyaar
    purchased parcels of land within the Business Center District and proceeded to begin development. This move
    helped it to form a significant foothold and paved the way to an innovative portfolio of projects. In July 2009,
    Deyaar completed its first development in Lebanon, Saifi Village II, and a USD 100 million residential project. 72
    exclusive apartments were designed, built and sold to families from the LEVANT and GCC that Deyaar believed
    would consider Saifi Village-II as their homes. Following the significant shifts in the global property markets, it is
    now planning to build low-cost housing in the nation to ensure consistent returns over the long-term.</p>
    <p>Internationally, despite the continuous political turmoil and the global financial crises Deyaar managed to overcome
    these challenges, complete the projects and ensure timely handovers. All this was done without compromising
    pricing and quality.</p>

        <p>Although the business groups from the UAE are
        focused on the future, they are guided by their
        past, and buoyed by the United Arab Emirates’ open trade
        policies and intrinsic values that respect different cultures.
        Prominent among the many high-risers from Abu Dhabi who

        <p>Creating a landmark project in affiliation with leading
        brands globally can be one of the most challenging
        tasks in property development. Furthermore, it was further
        amplified for several developers with the onset of the global
        financial slowdown in 2008. In an economic climate like
        this, Pearl Dubai emerged stronger by striding ahead with a
        vision based on designing a place that always tells a story. It
        is a unique company that was incorporated with a singular
        objective in mind: developing the flagship project Dubai
        Pearl, a mixed-use integrated luxury development.</p>
        <p>Pearl Dubai was formed in November 2006 in Dubai by
        a consortium of investors led by the Al Fahim Group, an
        Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate that boasts a substantial
        business portfolio that spans the automotive, oil, property,
        hospitality, travel, tourism and industrial sectors. The
        company’s flagship project Dubai Pearl is intended to be
        located in the heart of Dubai Technology and Media Free
        Zone (TECOM), overlooking Palm Jumeirah, and is poised to
        become the centre of the bustling metropolis of New Dubai.</p>
        <p>This landmark development will host 7 5-Star Hotels,
        1,400 offices, 60 restaurants and cafés, 1,800-seat theatre,
        1,500 branded residences, 580,000 sq. ft. of retail space and
        8 international spas, among others. Upon completion, it is
        ultimately expected to provide a home for 9,000 people and
        a workplace for 12,000.</p>

    <img src="images/dpearl-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
        <p>The mega development is conceived as a sustainable
        living city that transcends ordinary definitions of luxury, to
        offer the new concept of bespoke living in the region. The
        project will feature branded podium and tower residences,
        branded hospitality, retail, leisure and entertainment as well 
        as intelligent offices within a total built-up area spanning a
        staggering 20 million sq. ft.</p>
        <p>Pearl Dubai, from the start, set out to create a unique
        destination by partnering leading brands from around the
        world. As an extraordinary place to live, work, play and stay,
        Dubai Pearl brings together legendary international brands,
        to offer a lifestyle that is the ultimate in refined living. From
        Baccarat to Bellagio, MGM Grand, Skylofts and many more,
        the most respected brands make up Dubai Pearl, bringing
        their standards of excellence to the residences, hotels,
        restaurants, offices, retail, spas, theatres, boutiques and
        leisure facilities.</p>
        <p>The project sets a new benchmark for sustainable urban
        communities in Dubai and will redefine the pulse of the city,
        providing an unparalleled combination of freehold with
        luxury, energy-efficient sustainability and state-of-theart
        technology. Pearl Dubai reinforces its commitment to
        healthy and sustainable living by designing it to be a 24-hour
        ‘walkable’ city environment with over half of the total area to
        be a landscaped open space. On the CSR front, the company
        has set up the non-profit Dubai Pearl Creative Foundation
        and also raised over US$1.8 million in support of amfAR (The
        Foundation for AIDS Research). Moving forward, Dubai Pearl
        continues to announce several initiatives consistently to
        benefit communities globally under its active CSR calendar.</p>

    	<p>Among its numerous awards are the Sheikh Mohammed
        Bin Rashid Al Maktoum ‘Patron of the Arts’ for three
        consecutive years; Newsweek Award for ‘Best Integrated
        Development’ in 2009; and 4 ‘Arabian Property Awards’
        in 2010. Some of its other achievements include the
        largest contract in the region in 2008. The project has also
        garnered strong international support and acclaim through
        its Baccarat Hotel and Residences launch in Paris as well as
        regular roadshows across leading metropolises.</p>
        <p>As Dubai’s property market emerges from the slowdown
        with a renewed vigour and the UAE forges towards greater
        economic integration, Dubai Pearl is well-placed to be a
        glimmering example of the nation’s unwavering ambition.
        The project is moving ahead at a rapid pace with initial
        handover scheduled to commence in December 2014, in
        2 phases. Dubai Pearl has an estimated development sales
        value of USD 6 billion and over 90% of the released property
        has already been sold, evidencing its strong attraction for
        investors.</p>
        <p>Dubai Pearl is rising forth to offer ‘Life in balance’ in a
        place that partners established brands from around the
        world. It is a project that where global names that embody
        the heritage of different nations and cultures will converge
        together in harmony and luxury.</p>

   <b>Bringing MGM to the region</b>
        
    <p>The core appeal of Dubai Pearl is the strategic proposition that is brings international brand partnerships integrated
    into lifestyle offerings within a single location. This was reinforced in the year 2009, when it announced that the
    project will host Bellagio, MGM Grand and Skylofts to be developed with MGM Hospitality. MGM is a name that is
    renowned across the world as a purveyor of elite luxury and it owns and operates 17 properties in across the USA.</p>
    <p>The Bellagio Hotel at Dubai Pearl will blend modern Middle Eastern culture infused with the subtle Italian philosophy
    of ‘la Bella Figura’, while the MGM Grand is destined to become an iconic hotel. Adding more lure will be Skylofts, a
    stylish, contemporary, luxury boutique hotel that will offer discerning travellers an immersive sensory experience.
    In addition, MGM Royal Hall, a 1,800-seat multi-purpose cultural destination, will bring to the Middle East region
    uniquely tailored entertainment, including drama, theatre, dance, art, film and musicals all through the year.</p>
    <p>Complementing this are other major names including the French brand Baccarat that has embodied superior
    craftsmanship for over 200 years and Starwood Capital Group, a leader in real estate investments since 1991, to
    be a part of Dubai Pearl.</p>
    <p>Together, these names make Dubai Pearl truly international in appeal, which is slated to set new benchmarks for
    collaborations in property development on a global scale.</p>

        <p>After completing his engineering studies in the U.S. in
1971, Abdullah Ahmed Almoosa, a young entrepreneur
from the UAE, laid the foundation of the Group through an
architectural engineering firm. It is now grown into a leading
family owned diverse business group as one of the top ten
leading family owned groups in the UAE. The Group is more
popularly known as ARENCO GROUP from its architectural
practice which carries that name. The group’s business
interests have grown to include real estate, manufacturing
and trading. Not only that, its geographic market has also
expanded to cover the whole GCC.</p>
<p>ARENCO, the flagship and the largest of the group
companies, successfully delivered more than 2000 multidisciplinary
projects to date and has been actively involved in
all aspects of the building sector with a focus on hospitality,
commercial, offices, residential, retail, institutional,
educational, religious and industrial developments, offering
comprehensive services to clients throughout the Gulf
Region.</p>

<p>Falcon Tower, Trade Centre Residential Tower, Horizon
Tower Dubai Marina, Masakin Al Furjan, Hilton Jumeirah, 
Resort Hotel Palm Jumeirah Trunk, Four Points Sheraton,
Le Royal Meredien, Jumeirah Island Heights Fronds, Jafza
Convention Centre Development, Julfar Development Ras
Al Khaimah, Al Fanar Development Fujairah, Jumeirah
Beach Residence 3, Dune Centre, Dubai Outlet Mall, Al
Rais Centre and many other projects like Mosques, private
villas and residential complexes are some of the company’s
remarkable achievements in the UAE. The high exposure of
ARENCO Company to a diverse range of projects in different
sectors paved the group’s way to explore and carry out other
business activities, the reason why A. A. Almoosa group
became a large conglomerate throughout the years.</p>

<p>In 1972, the group started expanding its services’ base.
Thus, Thrifty Car Rental was established as a small car rental
company. With a focused vision, it became the largest car
rental company in the UAE with an extensive fleet of more
than 12,500 vehicles. In 2004, the group confirmed its
leading role in car rental business when it formed Zabeel
Rent A Car to operate the franchised Dollar Rent A Car in the
UAE. Expanding into the neighboring country Oman was in
2007 though Emirates Cars, a wholly-owned company by A.
A. Almoosa established to operate Dollar Rent A Car. This
signaled the group’s intention to go beyond the UAE.</p> 
		
<p>The group continued its expansion road in the following
years penetrating real estate, manufacturing and trading.
Arenco Real Estate was established in 1975 to serve the real 
estate requirements in Dubai. Today, it is one of the largest
private property Landlords, owning a range of properties
including luxury apartments, villa compounds, office towers,
staff accommodation, hotel apartments and warehouses.
Golden Sands Hotels was formed in 1999 as ARENCO’s
subsidiary to operate hotels in partnership with international
chains in the UAE and Oman.</p>

<p> Hilton Jumeirah Beach, Hilton JBR, Four Points Sheraton,
Four Points Sheraton Downtown and Ramada Plaza JBR
are some members of the company’s portfolio in the local
market. Crowne Plaza Muscat and Hilton Salalah are also
majority-owned and managed by the company.</p>
<p>Driven by its expansion strategy, the group established
a furniture manufacturing company in 1993 and a lighting
products manufacturing company in 1994, Dubai Furniture
Manufacturing and Gulf Advanced Lighting respectively.
They have developed as leading manufacturers in their fields,
matching international quality standards and established an
extensive worldwide network of distributors, wholesalers
and dealers.</p>
<p>The group’s business interests are growing, driven by
the positive economic sentiment, UAE’s friendly-business
environment and the group’s entrepreneurial spirit. Growing
from an architectural engineering firm to one of the UAE’s
largest conglomerates was not an easy journey. Hard work,
strong commitment and a lot of efforts have been invested indeed.</p>

   <b>Targeting a steadily-growing economy</b>
        
    <p>A. A. Almoosa Enterprises made its first entry in the regional market
    when it chose Oman to make its first investment. The decision came
    after a careful study of the Omani Tourism market that has been
    steadily growing for the last forty years. The group today owns more
    than 50% of the Crowne Plaza Muscat. This selection was based on
    the hotel’s strategic location as it is situated at the tip of Qurum Beach
    with scenic views of the Gulf of Oman, 15 minutes from Muttrah Souk,
    one of the most-visited attractions in Oman and 20 minutes from
    Muscat International airport and 10 minutes from the government and
    diplomatic districts.</p>
    <p>The Hilton Salalah Resort in Salalah is also majority-owned by the
    group. Surrounded by vibrant bougainvillea and lush palm groves, this
    beachfront resort is nestled amongst landscaped gardens. All hotel
    rooms and suites offer breathtaking views of the Indian Ocean and
    Arabian Sea, as well as the mighty Dhofar mountain range. Both hotels
    are managed by Golden Sands Hotels, a member of the group.</p>

        <p>When it comes to entrepreneurial spirit and inclusive
        regional growth, the UAE has set several precedents
        through individuals and enterprises that have carried the
        torch of progress beyond the nation. As one of the most
        important industries for economic diversification and
        development, property investments have been one of the
        strongest fortes associated with the country.</p>
        <p>Playing a key role in the redevelopment of Iraq is Sadara
        through its concept of the Liwan project, an upcoming
        integrated lifestyle development located in one of the most
        promising regions of the country. Sadara, renowned for its
        professional expertise and broad experience, is masterplanning
        this iconic project with the mission to provide
        premium lifestyle in Iraq through visionary real estate
        developments.</p>

        <p>Sadara, headquartered in Dubai, was founded by
        ambitious and foresighted businessmen from the UAE and
        the wider Arabian Gulf region. It combines extensive shared
        experienced in planning and developing real estate projects
        that has been gained through founding, managing and
        owning prominent developments. The company ensures that
        customer service takes top priority and brings a committed
        approach to ensuring utmost satisfaction at every level. It
        also places equal emphasis on best international practice,
        both in construction and in protecting clients’ rights.</p>
	
        <p>Liwan enjoys an excellent geographic location, rising
        six metres high from surrounding areas, in the centre of
        new developments in Al Naseriyah, the capital of the Dhi Qar 
        Governorate. It is located close to the archeologically
        important city of Ur, and leading to the new main city
        entrance, the new airport and the new American University
        in Al Naseriyah.</p> 
        <p>Upon completion, Liwan will be a 450,000 sq mt multifaceted
        development, planned to comprise 850 villas with
        high standards of lifestyle and essential facilities including a
        mall, mosque, schools and recreation centres, together with
        a modern infrastructure. It is all set to showcase a future that
        will bring prosperity to the nation’s citizens and enhance its
        status as an important core of the regional economy.</p>
        Among the strategic partners of Liwan are the Dhi Qar
        Governorate, Investment Authority of the Governorate of
        Dhi Qar and the Iraqi Businessmen’s Union. The project is
        planned, engineered and managed by Makiya Engineering
        Consultancy, a professional services company based in the
        Middle East with its headquarters in Dubai, UAE.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>Sadara, through well thought-out planning with an aim to
        ensure success for this important project, formulised highly
        competitive prices for the residential units in Liwan, which
        offer sound value along with exceptional infrastructure. The
        company continues to plan new ways of making this a unique
        investment opportunity, thereby turning it into an attractive
        option for both local as well as international prospective
        home-owners and investors.</p>
        <p>The project is a key part of the plan to highlight the city of
        Al Naseriyah as a tourist destination and an investment hub.
        Furthermore, the Dhi Qar Governorate is experiencing a highdemand
        for residential units, and official statistics estimate
        that the requirements for housing greatly exceed availability.
        Sadara, through the Liwan project has ensured that it carries
        the UAE’s vision to share the fruits of its progress across the
        region in order to fulfil an essential prerogative and bring an
        even brighter future to this vital destination in Iraq.</p>

   <b>Developing an icon in Iraq</b>
        
        <p>Sadara was formed with the implicit aim to develop strategic projects
        in the region, guided by its specialist knowledge and understanding
        of the Middle East, extending from North Africa to the Levant to the
        Arabian Gulf region. Its chose Iraq and more specifically the city of
        Al Naseriyah for its maiden project, Liwan, due to the historical and
        economic importance of this location.</p>
        <p>The city of Al Naseriyah has always had a unique place throughout
        history, not just as in terms of civilisation, but also as the birthplace
        of Iraq’s most famous artists and literary luminaries. Today, this city is
        witnessing an economic renaissance with plans underway for dozens
        of major commercial projects, as well as the development of promising
        tourism opportunities in the broader Dhi Qar Governorate.</p>
        <p>Decisively partnering Sadara in implementing this project is the
        Investment Authority of Dhi Qar, which is responsible for attracting
        foreign direct investments and in overcoming any difficulties facing
        investors. The first step towards the future success for Sadara came
        when it was awarded an Investment License in early 2010 for Liwan.
        Furthermore, the authority also approved all contracts and regulations
        of the project in order to protect buyers’ rights. This and several other
        positive advances have firmly put Sadara, and in turn Liwan, on the
        path to accomplishment and glory.</p>

        From day one, the groups’ founder, Abdulrahman Bukhatir
        built his model around technologies; which of them the
        local community needs and where to get them from. As a
        result, several joint ventures were formed and have greatly
        strengthened over the years. Collectively, they have infused
        diverse contemporary technologies into the United Arab
        Emirates and have helped the Bukhatir Group earn its well
        deserved recognition as a pioneer.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
        <p>In addition to these successful joint ventures, the group
        has also established a series of subsidiaries that enabled it to
        further diversify its portfolio both locally and internationally.
        One good example that explains Bukhatir’s business
        philosophy is the group’s association with Ghubash Group
        to form EMITAC, the UAE’s leading technology solutions
        provider. EMITAC’s annual turnover has exceeded USD 545
        million In addition to representing over 40 leading brands in
        the domestic market. EMITAC also operates through three
        subsidiaries for healthcare, enterprise and mobile solutions.
        Furthermore, EMITAC established a series of successful joint
        ventures, such as Avanza Solutions ME, SEDCO, EMITAC
        Jordan and Qatar Datamation Systems, thus increasing its
        breadth and depth of solutions and services offered to its
        customers.</p>
        <p>Bukhatir’s foreign investments follow a clear pathway that
        enables each company to act independently and swiftly to
        grow and expand its business beyond UAE boarders. In fact,
        almost every one of the Bukhatir companies has business
		activities both in the UAE and abroad.</p>
        
    <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/bukhat-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img --> 
    
    <p>But this doesn’t prevent the mother group from
    making direct investments in target markets; such as
    Hercules International Sports Tangier (HIST); a world-class
    multi functional sport, commercial, conference, chalets
    and exhibition facility in Tangier, Morocco. The project
    comprises a clubhouse with 80 five star quality rooms, a
    spa, a convention center, 70 villas, a championship 18-hole
    golf course, tennis/football academies and an international
    cricket stadium.</p>
    <p>On a different scale, Dubai Sports City, a mega
    development in which Bukhatir Group holds a significant
    stake is an iconic project of the group and similar sports
    cities are being set up in Tunisia, Pakistan and Morocco, with
    Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka and South Africa being the next
    destinations.</p>

   <b>Tunis Sports City: giving North Africa a Unique competitive angle</b>
        
        <p>As part of Bukhatir Group’s real estate network, Sports Cities
        International provides a glimpse of how this diversified group
        thinks when it comes to planning and investing globally.
        Construction of Tunis Sports City has actually started in summer
        2009 and is scheduled for completion in 2024. The 256 hectare
        development will be located in the northern suburbs of Tunisia’s
        capital city of Tunis and cost an estimated USD 5 billion to
        complete.</p>
       <p> Tunis Sports City is to comprise world-standard sports facilities
        that aim to attract international sports competitions. Upon
        completion, the complex will include residential towers, business
        centers, shopping malls, sports complexes, schools and hotels,
        in addition to a golf course certified by the Professional Golfers’
        Association. The completed development will house as many as
        30,000 people. Sports Cities will finance most of the project itself.</p>
        <p>Bukhatir Group’s push to develop “sports cities” outside the UAE
        was motivated in part by its experience in building Dubai Sports
        City, in which Bukhatir has a 33 percent stake.</p>

        <p>The key feature of the global highflyers from the UAE
        has been their contribution to the nation’s growth right
        before its inception. For these companies, the first priority in
        the early decades was diversifying the country’s economy in
        line with the founding leaders’ plans. Having set world-class
        standards at home, they have gone ahead to extend their
        innovative spirit to the wider region and the world beyond.
        An extraordinary role among these has been played by the
        Abu Dhabi-headquartered Al Jaber Group (AJC), which
        continues to make waves in the development of the region.</p>
        <p>AJC’s greatest strengths have been sustainable growth
        and diversification among its companies, which share
        common traits that, along with combined resources,
        continue to enable significant successes. Its name has been
        part of several of the highest profile projects in the region
        that have been achieved through a wide-ranging experience
        and expertise.</p>
        <p>AJC was established in 1970 and today is a market leader
        and the largest private sector employer in the UAE with
        60,000 plus employees and as the largest fleet of vessels,
        cranes, equipment and machinery in the UAE.</p>
        
        <div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/aljaber-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have historically been
        the principal markets for AJC’s business activities with wellestablished
        and long-standing relationships with government,
        semi-government and private sector clients. However, due
        to the AJC’s diversified nature, it also has exposure to export
        markets all over the world and particularly in the Middle East
        and Africa (MEA) region and the Far East.</p>
	
        <p>In the field of construction, AJC, as one of the largest
        construction contractors in the region, has engineered over
        5,000 km of roads, more than 3,200 villas and landmark 
        commercial buildings. Al Jaber Group (AJC) is also an industry
        leader in oil and gas pipelines construction work, oil rigs
        refurbishment, industrial fabrication, heavy lifting and heavy
        transportation. The group possesses over 320 cranes in its
        fleet as well as the country’s largest construction equipment/
        vehicle fleet comprising more than 10,000 units, managed
        under a single umbrella.</p> 
        <p>Further to these, AJC has more than 30 years of
        history of land and sea transportation and logistics in the
        UAE, its fleet includes 32 ships with worldwide marine

        per year. It operates the only Chlor-Alkali plant in the UAE.
        Additionally, AJC’s state-of-the-art precision engineering
        workshops specialises in the manufacturing of high precision
        engineering components and units.</p>

    Aviation (AJA), a name that is synonymous with luxury and
    management excellence for private aircrafts.</p>

    reputation as a diversified group of companies whose
    performance is based on the ability to utilise the synergies
    between each and management of risk through strong
    controls. Its milestones in success over 40 years have made it
    the premier engineering and construction group in the region
    with phenomenal figures that include over 50 companies,

   <b>Partnering in Qatar’s triumph</b>
        
    <p>An example of Al Jaber’s prudent expansion strategies is its foray in Qatar. The group entered this rising nation
    in the year 2002 by establishing Al Jaber and Partners - Construction and Energy Projects W.L.L., bringing with
    it decades of experience and the backing of USD 5.5 billion worth of assets of its parent company based in Abu
    Dhabi. AJP was set up to serve the growing infrastructure market in Qatar and was one of the first to identify the
    latent potential of this market.</p>
    <p>This early move turned it into one of the largest construction firms in Qatar with several signature projects
    to its name. These include the New Doha International Airport (NDIA), engineering the landfill, earthwork and
    reclamation at Pearl Qatar, GTL Project at Ras Laffan and the Lusail Development among others.</p>
    <p>AJP’s proud tradition of high-quality, high-end engineering and construction developments with an excellent
    health and safety record makes it one of the largest, safest and most prestigious construction companies in the
    region. In Qatar, it was awarded the ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 certifications in recognition of the
    company’s occupational health and safety, environmental and high-quality management systems.</p>
    <p>Today, AJP is on course for USD 275 million turnover during the year 2012 with a committed workforce of close
    to 4,000 professionals and a modern fleet of nearly 2000 vehicles and heavy construction equipment. In addition,
    the Company has set up a main workshop within an area of 25,000 sq meters and a pre-cast yard of 10,000 sq
    meters in the industrial area. It has four asphalt and nine screening and crushing plants in Qatar and a 2,000 sq
    meters head office in Doha.</p>

        <p>The UAE is famed for the awe-inspiring architectural
        icons that dot its landscape, built in several instances
        by home-grown engineering and construction experts that
        consistently pursue quality and excellence. Many of these
        firms from the country have also played a major role in
        constructing prominent landmarks in the Middle East and
        Africa (MEA) region. Leading this trend for over two decades
        has been the Al Shafar (ASGC) Holding, a group with diverse
        construction-related ventures that are active in the region.</p>
        <p>The holding’s flagship company, AI Shafar General
        Contracting (AGGC) has been at the forefront of its growth

        of Dubai’s growth story, devoting its expertise to over 250
        projects worth billions of dollars and delivering the highest
        level of quality consistently.</p>

   <b>Constructing the Egypt of tomorrow</b>
        
    <p>When ASGC decided to expand overseas, its sights were set on the
    GCC nations. Even as it made strong inroads in Saudi Arabia and
    Qatar, it aimed to foray further into the promising North African
    markets, primarily Egypt. It gained instant recognition by bagging
    contracts for prominent future landmarks. Prime among these is
    Marassi, a gated, master-planned resort development, slated to be
    one of the most prestigious beach communities in Egypt. ASGC’s
    scope in this project includes construction of over 300 villas and
    town houses. Aside from this, it was also awarded another key
    contract from Emaar Misr for its Mivida project.</p>
    <p>Its experience and proven expertise in the field of construction
    brought it yet another prestigious project in Egypt; the iconic
    Winter Palace Hotel in Luxor. Its scope of work in the project
    included constructing the extension of this historical hospitality
    destination for the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and

    the UAE, it remains a key example of the nation’s continuous
    pursuit of ambitious goals and unwavering excellence through well

        <p>Founded in 1998, National Central Cooling Company
        PJSC, commonly known as Tabreed (meaning “cooling”
        in Arabic), is a leading district cooling service provider
        headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab
        Emirates. From its base in Abu Dhabi, Tabreed has benefited
        from an advanced infrastructure network and a business
        friendly environment along with an ideal location that allows
        the company to provide its innovative cooling solutions to its
        clients throughout GCC region.</p>
        <p>Tabreed’s growth over the years owes a great deal to
        necessity and innovation. The hot and arid climate of the
        Middle East meant that a system for cooling dense urban
        developments was essential for supporting demographic and
        economic growth. In the last decade alone, the GCC region
        has witnessed tremendous growth as billions of dollars have
        been invested in diversifying regional economies. As an
        energy and cost efficient alternative to traditional cooling
        systems, district cooling quickly became the preferred choice
        for cooling large commercial, residential and government
        projects. The high level of demand for district cooling in the
        UAE has facilitated Tabreed’s national growth, which in turn
        paved the way for its regional expansion.</p>
        
        
	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/tabreed-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>The company’s portfolio now includes 59 plants across the
        UAE - 52 wholly owned and operated by Tabreed and seven
        operated through its affiliates and subsidiaries. Some of its
        high profile projects in the UAE include Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island,
        Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and Dubai Metro. The evident
        success on these local mega projects have demonstrated the
        company’s ability and commitment to deliver on large and
        complex projects across the region and beyond.</p>
	
        <p>In 2003, Tabreed entered the Qatari Market by launching
        Qatar Cool, a private sector joint venture company owned
        by Tabreed, United Development Company, and other
        private Qatari investors. Qatar Cool currently operates the
        world’s largest district cooling plant on The Pearl. Since then,
        Tabreed has expanded its regional operations to include
        Bahrain in 2004. In 2006, it also signed an agreement with
        Saudi Arabia’s ‘A. Abunayyan Group’ to launch Saudi Tabreed.
        In 2008, Tabreed Oman was established as a partnership
        between Tabreed and a group of Omani shareholders
        comprising the Ministry of Defense Pension Fund, the Diwan
        of Royal Court Pension Fund, the ISS Pension Fund, PMA
        International Ltd and Private Projects Development Co. LLC.</p>
        
                
	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/tabreed-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>Today, Tabreed has an installed capacity of over 605,000 RT
        in the UAE, and the group’s capacity in the region (excluding the UAE) 
        now stands at 161,800 RT. With a total installed
        capacity of over 766,000 RT in the GCC, servicing clients such
        as the Bahrain Financial Harbour, Knowledge Oasis Muscat
        and Saudi Aramco, the company has successfully spread its
        wings across the region.</p>

        <p>Moreover, Tabreed has regularly won awards and industry
        certifications for its groundbreaking work on the region’s
        most prestigious projects. In 2004 and 2006, it received
        two gold awards from the International District Energy
        Association (IDEA). In 2007, it received IDEA’s Global
        Partner and two world awards. Additionally, it received
        three major international certifications in managing
        Quality, Environment Occupational health and safety for
        its operations in production and supply of chilled water for
        district cooling services in the region.</p>

   <b>The Largest Cooling Plant in the world – The Pearl, Qatar</b>
        
    <p>Through its joint venture, Qatar Cool, Tabreed has played a
    vital role in developing the world’s largest district cooling
    plant at The Pearl – Qatar. The plant has a maximum capacity
    of 130,000 RT and has been designed to enable the growth
    of one of Doha’s most prestigious and exciting developments.</p>
    <p>Serving the entire development, the plant is fully equipped
    to supply chilled water to 41,000 residents, hotels, shopping
    centers, villas and other facilities on the Island through a
    piping network totaling 90 kilometers in length.</p>
    <p>At certain times of the year, up to 70 percent of the power
    used during peak times can be attributed to air conditioning
    systems. Given that district cooling can be 40-60% more
    efficient than traditional cooling systems, and much more
    reliable, district cooling was seen as the ideal solution for The
    Pearl – Qatar.</p>
    <p>The plant was inaugurated in November 2010 at a glittering
    ceremony attended by ministers, ambassadors and
    participants of the International District Cooling Conference.
    The Pearl - Qatar plant is emblematic of Doha’s ambitions and
    Tabreed’s expertise in delivering high profile projects that are
    underpinning the continued growth of the Middle East.</p>
