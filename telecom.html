        "In recent years, the Etisalat Group (EG) has been successfully engaged in a
strategy of growing its international operations at record rates, while also
maintaining the core strength of its domestic business in the UAE.
Looking forward, the worldwide telecommunications industry – with
revenues of approximately USD1.7 trillion at the end of 2011 – will continue
to represent a sizeable and attractive industry. In the coming years, the
sector’s growth potential will be driven largely by emerging markets,
where EG will continue to play an active role. In Etisalat’s current footprint
alone, it is envisaged that there will be significant growth potential in the
telecommunications industry, providing it ample room for further growth.
EG’s 2017 vision and mission have been established with these thoughts
in mind. The pillars of Service Offering, Customer Experience, Operational
Excellence, Portfolio, One Company and People & Culture are the
cornerstones of the organisation’s five-year strategy.”</div><!-- mes_ceo -->

        <p>Technology has eased the ways for people to stay in
touch and connect across borders. The United Arab
Emirates, with its policy openness and sharing, has been at
the forefront of both the telecommunication as well as the
digital revolution in the region. For nearly 40 years, Etisalat
has helped the UAE sustain its position as the region’s
main hub for business, trade and foreign investment by
providing reliable and high-quality services. It has been the
key to powering its home country into the top ten nations
list for adoption of technology by providing the latest
advancements first.</p>
<p>Emirates Telecommunication Corporation (Etisalat), was
established in the year 1976 as a joint venture between
international Aeradio Limited, a British Company and
local partners. Today, it is the Middle East’s leading
telecommunications operator and one of the largest
corporations in the six among the GCC countries.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/etisal-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Starting off by unleashing the potential of technology as
a pioneer, Etisalat launched the Middle East’s first mobile
network in the year 1982. The next year saw its ownership
structure change for stronger foundations with the UAE
government holding 60% of the company and the remaining
40% publicly-traded. This combination between public
and private sector made the organisation moved quickly
toward the modern innovation in telecommunication fields.Continuing its track-record of innovation, it introduced the
Middle East’s first GSM service introduced in the UAE in 1994,
followed by rollout of internet services across the country in
the next year, another first in the region.</p>
	
<p>Etisalat’s international acquisition programme began
in earnest in 2004 when it won the second mobile license
and the first third-generation (3G) mobile license in Saudi
Arabia. From thereon, it continued to surge forward by
acquiring a stake in a green-field operator in Nigeria in 2007
and investing in Excelcomindo, one of the leading mobile
service providers in Indonesia, closely followed by operations
in several other nations in the Middle East & Africa (MEA)
region and beyond. While in the UAE, in 2010, the company
propelled it as one of the first five countries in the world with
a 3D television service.</p>
<p> Etisalat is a pioneer in next-generation networks for both
fixed-line and wireless services and it has deployed enough
fibre-optic cable in the UAE to reach from the earth to the
moon eight times. It currently owns the Middle East’s fastest
fixed-line broadband network with speeds of up to 30 megabits
per second (Mbps). As an industry leader in innovation,
Etisalat has trialled the world’s fastest mobile broadband
service with speeds up to 300 Mbps.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/etisal-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>This technological expertise has helped Etisalat to capture
significant market share as it expands across the region, most
notably in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where the introduction of
mobile broadband services, including video call and mobile
television, has changed the market dynamics and provided
affordable Internet access for millions. The conglomerate
is also in the process of launching 4G mobile services in the
UAE and Saudi Arabia, and today operates the Middle East’s
largest LTE network.</p>
	<p>Keeping its leadership intact in complementing fieldsis Etisalat Services, the holding company for the various
services and support functions offered through individual
business units. These include e-Facility management (e-FM),
e-Real estate (e-Re), Etisalat Academy, Ektibar Card Systems
and Tamdeed Projects, among others.</p>
<p>Etisalat has been named ‘Best Overall Operator’ in the
Middle East ten times since 2006 and “Best Wholesale
Provider” four times in the last three years as well as three
prestigious wins at the 2012 Global Mobile Awards. It has
won numerous accolades for its innovative marketing,
being awarded for having the “Best Brand”, “Best Customer
Service” and “Best CSR Programme”.</p>
	<p>One of Etisalat’s core values is service to the community,
a commitment to give back to improve the lives of people
and to protect the environment for future generations. It
supports, sponsors and participated in a wide array of social,
economic, and environmental initiatives across the Middle
East, Asia and Africa, working closely with governments, other companies, and foundations.</p>

    <img src="images/etisal-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>It also builds products and services for those with special
needs in the firm belief that all members of society deserve
the same freedom of communication. Caring for the
shared resources, Etisalat has pioneered several advanced
“green” technologies and is a regional leader in providing
environmentally-friendly information and communication
solutions. These include smart building technologies, the
latest Machine-to-Machine (M2M) solutions and the
deployment of alternative power within its regional networks.
Its futuristic nationwide fibre-optic network in the UAE is
expected to reduce carbon emissions by over 80 percent and
energy consumption by over 70 percent.</p>
<p>Surging ahead in a world in which technology extends
the reach, through its values of energy, openness and
enablement, it is actively developing newer and more
advanced networks that enable people to develop, to learn
and to grow. The organisation is rated Aa3 by Moody’s, AAby
Standard & Poor’s and A+ by Fitch Ratings, giving it some
of the highest ratings for a telecommunications company
anywhere in the world. Etisalat’s market value currently
stands at approximately US$22 billion with annual revenues
of over US$ 9 billion.</p>
<p>Showcasing its continued success, Etisalat reported net
profits of US$3.6 billion for 2012, ranking it as one of the
most profitable telecoms group in the world. This blue-chip
organisation with operations in 18 countries across the
Middle East, Africa and Asia benefits an estimated 2 million
people from regular work, including 53,000 who are directly
employed by it. Having witnessed rapid expansion, Etisalat
has positioned itself as one of the world’s fastest growing
operators, with worldwide subscribers surging around 3,475
percent from 4 million in 2004 to 141 million in 2013.</p>

   <b>Bringing state-of-the-art telecom to Sudan</b>
        
<p>Etisalat was one of the key participants in the
remarkable transformation and achievements
witnessed in the Sudanese telecommunication
sector. In the year 2006, it joined other
founding partner companies to launch Canar
Telecom, a fixed-line telecom services operator.</p>
<p>By offering innovative and high quality services,
Canar has steadily increased its customer base
in the fixed telecom market to enjoy 61.5%
overall market share in fixed-line in Sudan. It
grew its customer base by over 50% in 2007
with continued upward trends and its coverage
saw an increase of 122% compared to 2006.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Canar’s fibre optic backbone
extends to 3.070 km nationally and 850 locallyin the major cities to serve mobile operators, ISPs and corporate and business clients across the country. To further
expand its services, Canar has launched Sudan Landing station in May 2007 to provide international connectivity
linked with 122,000 km of submarine cables, making Sudan, East Africa’s Internet gateway to the entire world.</p>
<p>During 2009, fibre optic links between Sudan and Ethiopia were rolled out as part of overall plans to expand the
Canar fibre network across all neighbouring countries. This resulted in maximising use of its submarine landing
station, which is an integral part of the operator’s wholesale offer in international connectivity for the region.</p>
<p>Reflecting its confidence in the company, Etisalat raised its stake in Canar during 2007 from 37% to 82% by
investing close to USD $159 million. Continuing the innovative approach of its partner, Canar is also one of the first
operators in Africa to use an NGN network core.</p>

   <b>Positive dynamism in Afghanistan</b>
        
<p>Etisalat believes in contributing to all aspects of development by adopting practical and effective ways of bringing
progress to the world at large. An example of this is its launch of Etisalat Afghanistan in 2007 as its 100% owned
GSM operator to support the revival of the nation. It has rapidly become the fastest growing telecommunications
service provider of the country with an active base of 3 million subscribers.</p>

<p>The company aims to be at the forefront of its market based on quality, innovative services and competitive
pricing, with unsurpassed coverage in every province in the country. Since 2007, company has invested US$
300 million in Afghanistan. It has also signed a deal with Afghanistan Telecommunications Regulatory Authority
(ATRA) for conducting of a Rural Telecom Development project in 17 rural districts in 9 provinces by building and
operating 23 BTS sites.</p>

<p>In line with company’s long standing resolve of partnering in the development of human capital and skill levels
of local Afghan employees, the company launched the Employee Succession Plan to train and develop Afghan
nationals into future senior management positions. It is also the official mobile phone company of Afghanistan
national cricket team.</p>

<p>Etisalat Afghanistan operates out of Kabul and as of March 2010, the company achieved 24 percent market share
in 27 provinces of Afghanistan. The operator, driven by its group, is providing unmatched connectivity to its
customers through roaming agreements with 120 operators in 78 countries.</p>

    <div id="co_text">
    
        <p>Thuraya Telecommunications Company was formed
in April 1997 by a group of eight major national
telecommunications operators and investment houses as
a Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) operator headquartered
in Dubai. A total capital amounting to USD 500 million was
raised, paving the way for an agreement to be signed with
Boeing to manufacture Thuraya’s first satellite.</p>
<p>The company continued on building its foundations by
raising USD 475 million through a consortium of financial
institutions in 1999. In the year of 2000, Thuraya became the
Middle East’s first mobile telecommunications satellite when
it launched its first satellite from the Pacific Ocean. After
the launch of the second satellite in 2003, its subscribers
hit 100,000 users. In 2008, a third satellite was launched,
expanding the network coverage across Asia and Australia.</p>
	
<p>Thuraya makes a clear example as a UAE-based company
that succeeded to not only become an international telecom
company but also grew to be one of the top five international
satellite telecom operators. Its voice and data solutions
are used in more than 140 countries across Europe, Africa,
the Middle East, Asia and Australia. The success keys of
Thuraya, in my opinion, are represented in three elements:
the increasing immensity of its coverage area through a
successive launch of satellites, the uniqueness and modernity
of its solutions and products and the focus of its marketing
strategy on specific targets.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/thuraya-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
<p>Thuraya succeeded in developing competitive innovative
telecom solutions and products that are mainly via satellite
mainly to people working in remote locations where
terrestrial networks are useless. This has also contributed to the international success of the company. An example
of its recent products is ‘the Thuraya XT-DUAL’ – a dualmode
satellite phone, offered in March 2012. This handheld
featured both GSM and satellite capabilities. Earlier on
August 2009, Thuraya offered a satellite phone described as
the toughest phone in the world ‘the Thuraya XT handset’.
The uniqueness of these high-tech products generated more
demand for Thuraya’s products from local and international
markets; a strong market response was received as a result.</p>
<p>In the satellite broadband market, Thuraya has also
made major inroads with the introduction of Thuraya IP
and IP+, plug and play satellite broadband devices. As a
recent example of the company’s international success, in
July 2013, AVIWEST, a company headquartered in Rennes,
France that provides digital video equipment and solutions,
received certification from Thuraya to use Thuraya IP and IP+
broadband terminals on its equipment for live streaming .</p> 
<p>In line with providing competitive solutions for specific
markets, Thuraya has launched satellite voice, data and fax
terminals: SF2500™, Seagull 5000i and Seagull 5000. These
devices were designed mainly for small and medium-sized
fishing vessels, leisure and surveillance boats operating
in harsh maritime environments. Its robust exterior can
withstand extremely high temperatures and humid
conditions. The Indonesian Fisherman Association was an
early adopter of the SF2500™. Its advanced GPS navigation system allows sea-vessels to document and transmit critical
location and time information, optimizing costs and fleet
operations.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/thuraya-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>The company’s tendency to continue improving its services
is also a success key that should always be considered to
stay healthy in the telecom competitive market. In addition,
knowing the localized market and its changing requirements
are significant for a company that plans to go abroad. Thus,
Thuraya established a ‘Point Of Presence’ (POP) and ‘Meet
Me Point’ (MMP) in Singapore to enhance the performance of
the IP in Asia. The POP allows IP consumers, especially media
broadcasters streaming services from remote locations to
newsrooms and data centers across Asia.</p>
<p>Thuraya has concluded roaming agreements with more
than 350 mobile GSM operators around the world, making it
the only satellite operator to offer roaming between satellite
and GSM. In July 2012, the company launched its roaming
service in the USA in partnership with the American mobile
operator, T-Mobile. This service allows Thuraya customers to
roam seamlessly on the nationwide T-Mobile network that
reaches 96 percent of Americans.</p>
<p>As a dynamic mobile satellite services operator,
Thuraya continues to innovate and develop specialised
communications solutions to meet the needs of its growing
customer base.</p>

   <b>Contributing positively to the society</b>
        
<p>As most UAE-based international investors, Thuraya has a built-in CSR policy. It has partnered with humanitarian
agencies, NGOs and educational institutions such as International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and NetHope.
Some examples of its work with the ITU include deploying its Thuraya XT handsets in support of emergency
communications in Japan, immediately after the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.</p>
<p>Thuraya has also provided its services to support the setup of disaster surveillance centers in Uganda, Philippines
and Turkey. In addition, it contributed in helping to save lives in Samoa, China, Malawi, Pakistan, and Indonesia
when these countries were hit by terrible natural disasters.</p>
<p>Through its global network of Service Partners to support and sponsor a range of social responsibility projects and
activities across its satellite footprint, Thuraya recently donated an IP terminal and free airtime to the Rory Peck
Trust, which is the only organization in the world providing direct, practical support to freelance newsgatherers
and their families around the world.</p>
<p>Thuraya has understood that contributing positively to the society is a significant key of success in both local and
international markets.</p>

   <b>Yahsat: Empowering Africa for the digital age</b>
        
<p>Yahsat like all other UAE companies has reached out to poor African countries helping to connect villages with
urban areas using revolutionary satellite technologies. Among these are satellite broadband internet service
named “YahClick,” a service offered for the first time in many countries of the Sub-Saharan Africa. “YahClick”
offers uninterrupted high-speed internet usage to home users and enterprises through ‘Yahsat 1B,’ Yahsat’s second
satellite launched in April 2012 Shortly after the launch of the satellite, “YahClick”was available through service
partners in many countries across Africa. Yahsat is fast-tracking the service partners’ ability to offer broadband
service with zero investment in system infrastructure while service partners will be given technical, operational
and marketing support to bring high speed internet to users. A number of service plans, tailor-made for specific
markets and user segments for individuals and organisations in the public and private sector, is available through
Yahsat’s partners in each African country. “YahClick” has accelerated the deployment of broadband service and
bring the internet to millions of underserved and unserved people and organizations at costs comparable to
terrestrial services in Africa.</p>

        <p>Technology is innovating and re-inventing itself at a
remarkable pace, as it shapes the future pathway
for human progress. As one of the few fields where global
collaboration and knowledge-sharing are paramount to
growth, several key technology hubs have emerged across
the world. Amidst these, Advanced Technology Investment
Company (ATIC) is committed to ensuring that Abu Dhabi
becomes a major hub in the global technology network by
supporting and driving its innovation.</p>
<p>One of the key driving forces for ATIC is the Abu Dhabi
Economic Vision 2030, which provides a long-term strategy
for achieving the primary goals of a safe and secure society
alongside a dynamic open economy. Geared towards making
it a reality and supported by the UAE’s friendly economic
ties, ATIC was formed in 2008 as a specialist investment
company mandated to focus primarily on the global
advanced technology sector. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Mubadala Development Company, a multi-industry global
conglomerate established by the Government of Abu Dhabi
as a catalyst for the emirate’s economic diversification.</p>
<p>ATIC has a clear and single purpose: to deliver superior
financial returns to its shareholders by responsibly and
sustainably investing in, and building, leading technology
companies around the world. Towards this, it has till
date delivered significant strategic initiatives in industry,
education and research to build solid foundations for future
prosperity.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/atic-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
 
<p>One of its first successes in the field came just within the
second year of its operations when ATIC and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) launched GLOBALFOUNDRIES during March
2009 with Dresden’s Fab 1 as its anchor. Focused on serving
customer needs at the leading edge, it is geared towards
collaboration on specific R&D projects like cool silicon and
linear collider.</p>
<p>Moving further by investing into yet another promising
venture, ATIC invested in Calxeda based in Texas, USA during
the year 2010. Calxeda is at the forefront of innovations
looking to revolutionize energy efficiency in data centers
through the development of ARM-based ultra-low power
solutions for servers. Calxeda EnergyCore Server-on-a-
Chip (SoC) products offer intelligent power optimisation
and can deliver a reduction of up to 90% in overall power
consumption.</p>
<p>Another one of ATIC’s investments in this field is
Intermolecular, which pioneers new collaborative approaches
that accelerate R&D, innovation and time-to-market for
partners in the semiconductor and clean energy industries.</p>

<p>ATIC’s approach is fundamentally different to that of other
technology-focused investment organisations. Recognising
that real change takes time, and that value-creation is more
about sustainable wealth generation than short-term profit
creation, it is committed to a long-term investment horizon.</p>
<p>This patient capital approach ensures that its investments
are strategic and transformational rather than tactical and opportunistic. As a result, it enables them to deliver superior
returns to both its portfolio companies and its shareholder.
At its core, the company’s strategy comes down to three core
assets – its patient capital philosophy, its perspective and its
people.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/atic-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>ATIC works closely with the full spectrum of educational
institutions in Abu Dhabi and the UAE to raise awareness of
and interest in science and technology among young people.
One of its key initiatives is Al Nokhba, which is empowering
elite young Emiratis with the global experience needed to
lead in the advanced technology-driven industries. Towards
this goal, 20 elite Emirati students were awarded Al Nokhba
Scholarship for Advanced Technology in 2012. ATIC is also
involved in TECH QUEST, a youth engagement initiative
designed to recruit, inspire and develop the UAE’s best
national talent as well as a placement partner for the Higher
Diploma in Electronic Systems Engineering Technology
(HDESET) at Abu Dhabi Polytechnic.</p>
<p>ATIC also benefits from the insights and experience of a
diverse network of expert advisors from around the world.
Its team, including the Board of Directors and outside
advisors, shares a strong culture and a common vision
which underpins the success of the company. At present,
ATIC’s potential scope is global to be focused on leading
technology companies and centres in Europe, the USA and
Asia, underpinned by its shareholder’s AA+ rating.</p>

   <b>Global success from the Silicon Valley</b>
        
<p>ATIC’s patient capital philosophy and responsible
investing have resulted in GLOBALFOUNDRIES becoming
a key player in its own right. Through aggressive
investments made in technology and capacity and
strategic engagements with leaders like ARM, Qualcomm
and STMicro, the company has grown from strength-to strength.</p>
<p>In September 2009, ATIC acquired Charted Semiconductor
and integrated it with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, thus creating
the first truly global foundry in the world. Recognising its
commendable effort, it was chosen as the GLOBAL M&A
deal of the year for excellence in deal-making by the Global
Mergers and Acquisitions Network in New York 2012.</p>
<p>As of now, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has eight fabrication
facilities, of which six are in Singapore, one in Dresden,
Germany, and one in New York State, USA. The network
encompasses approximately 184,000 square meters of
clean room space and last year produced in excess of
4.5 million wafers. The company serves more than 150
leading industry customers including most of the top 20 IC
companies and employs approximately 10,000 employees
spanning three continents across 12 locations.</p>
<p>In March 2012, ATIC acquired full ownership of
GLOBALFOUNDRIES and in the next month its fabrication
plant in Malta, New York, which is currently the largest
commercial capital expansion project in the USA, came
online. Today, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is the world’s second
largest independent semiconductor foundry and ATIC is
all set to take this to success to the next level with up to
US$ 10 billion in committed investment for the future.</p>

        <p>SmartCity was established in October 2006 as a
conglomerate promoted by Dubai Holding member,
TECOM Investments, a global leading Business Park and Free
Zone developer. SmartCity was founded in accordance to the
diversification strategy of strengthening TECOM’s position
on the international arena, and was given the mandate
to develop and manage Knowledge Industry Townships
worldwide. TECOM’s decision to expand its operations and
diversify its services internationally was made in order to
enhance its shareholder value, add other revenue sources
and growth markets, and to leverage existing corporate
expertise in the development and management of Business
Parks.</p>

<p>SmartCity has taken Dubai Internet City (DIC) as its main
headquarters, which has played a vital role in its journey of
success. The company can utilise the strong infrastructure
provided within TECOM entities, as well as the flexibility
provided by Dubai legislation to support the business
environment. Based on the successful models of Dubai
Internet City and Dubai Media City, SmartCity develops and
provides an Infrastructure and environment that supports
the growth of knowledge-based companies. It provides
many value-added services for companies including a onestop-
shop of Business Support services, a range of Retail,
Hospitality, Residential and Recreational facilities, cuttingedge
ICT Infrastructure, excellent After-sales Support, and
enhanced and easy Government Services.</p>
	
<p>The company has had a significant impact on the
economies in which it was established through the creation
of vibrant knowledge-economy communities, which are
anchored by leading global, regional and local names in the industry to facilitate knowledge transfer and job creation.
SmartCity also creates a global network to assist its business
partners in tapping into various markets, opportunities and
talent. SmartCity Kochi, along with SmartCity Malta, are
the first two projects to be part of the global network of
knowledge-based industry townships that SmartCity seeks
to develop. This global network fosters productive linkages
and taps into synergies between knowledge-industry centres
worldwide. </p>

<p>SmartCity has also signed two agreements with two
different Governments to invest over USD 800 million. It
won the Best Investment in Europe’ award at the World
Investment Conference in France, La Baule in 2009 for its
investment and development of SmartCity Malta.</p>
<p>Committed to its values of integrity, collaboration, and
excellence, SmartCity has set its sights on creating a global
network of self-sustained business townships to foster the
knowledge economy.</p>

   <b>Taking knowledge-based communities to Malta</b>
        
<p>The UAE’s trade policy and business environment have enabled the
country to prosper with a spirit of Free Trade and Open Economy,
contributing greatly to the achievements of SmartCity. Business
partners and governments around the world recognise the UAE-based
SmartCity as a trustworthy partner which can build the same economic
opportunities in other regions as well.</p>
<p>As the biggest Foreign Direct Investment in Malta, SmartCity has
significantly contributed towards the promotion of Malta as the
destination for knowledge-based companies from across the globe
to cater to the European and North African markets. To simplify
business relations with Malta, the UAE has signed the Avoidance of
Double Taxation Agreement with the Government of Malta, which has
enhanced trade, investment and business opportunities between the
two countries. This agreement has had a positive impact on TECOM
Business Parks’ clients.</p>
<p>Besides the transparency of the UAE’s Trade Policy, SmartCity required
the strong backing and support of Malta, as well as a common ICT vision.
With Malta’s ‘Smart Island’ vision, the Government of Malta has made
tremendous efforts to build a solid foundation towards becoming a
hub within the global ICT network. It is testament to the success of the
SmartCity group that they formed all the necessary synergies with the
Government of Malta to create a unique destination in the heart of the
Mediterranean, as home to a vibrant knowledge-economy community
anchored by leading local, regional and global companies.</p>

   <b>EIT: Investing in the leading Malta telecommunications service provider</b>
        
<p>GO is Malta’s leading communications services company. As the only quad play provider in Malta, the company
provides mobile, fixed-line, broadband and TV services to more than 500,000 customers. GO also provides
unrivalled services to the Maltese business community including Cloud Services, roaming hub services, data
networking solutions, business IP services, and managed and co-location facilities.</p>
<p>The Company’s growth and success has been built on a focussed strategy to deliver a world-class service in
terms of infrastructure and customer experience. GO has achieved this by investing heavily in its fibre-powered
infrastructure and is the first and only Maltese operator whose network is directly connected to the World Wide
Web through two submarine cables.</p>
<p>GO is also the only Maltese operator with a fully integrated fixed-to-mobile network whose mobile base stations
are connected to a fibre network. This provides seamless speeds which reach up to 42Mbps for mobile internet
download as well as 3.5G (LTE ready) coverage throughout the Maltese Archipelago. The Company is also the
first and only one in Malta to provide a truly fibre powered fixed broadband service with speeds of up to 200Mbps.
Since 2007, GO has also been a leading player in Malta’s television market.</p>
<p>Today, the company owns the exclusive local broadcasting rights for the UEFA Champions League, the Barclays
Premier League, the Italian Serie A, the French Ligue 1 as well as Formula 1 and Rugby. These channels, as well as
premium movies and a variety of exclusive content, are also available in Interactive and HD TV.</p>
<p>Through its network of retail outlets across the Maltese Islands, its 24/7 customer call centre, its network
of authorised dealers, and dedicated B2B support, GO cements its position as a provider of world-class
communications services.</p>
<p>GO’s pioneering role in Malta’s communications industry is based on a tradition which goes back to 1975 when
Telemalta, the country’s first national telecommunications company was established.</p>
<p>This tradition was enhanced following the investment by Emirates International Telecommunications – EIT – a Dubai
based Holding Company, which acquired a 60 per cent stake in 2006, and rebranded the Company. GO’s remaining
shares are traded on the Malta Stock Exchange. With continued multi-million dollar investment programmes in
both infrastructure and human resources, GO’s pioneering tradition is set to continue long into the future.</p>

        <p>As one of the pre-eminent privately owned business
conglomerates in the United Arab Emirates, the
Belhasa Group started as a vision of its founder and current
chairman, Dr. Ahmed Saif Belhasa in the mid 60’s. During the
early days of the Group’s life, its activities focused mostly on
trading. With limited personal resources but careful planning
and direction, the Group gradually expanded from trading
into construction, then into construction materials and then
into services, doing business not only in the region but also
internationally.</p>
<p>Through successive expansions phases, the Group has
brought more than 25 companies under its fold. The group
began its journey in the trading sphere by establishing Union
Trading Co LLC in 1968 to trade with other Arab countries
in imported used cars and equipment for power projects.
The company established itself by gaining a considerable
number of infrastructure projects across the UAE. It has
also established business alliances with a number of Arab
and international companies which it currently represents in
Dubai.</p>
	
<p>In 2001, The Group decided to fly higher in the international
space of the trading sector by signing a joint venture with
Roam-Chemie of Belgium to form BioTek Solutions LLC. The
company was given the objective of delivering effective, safe
and environment friendly products to eliminate biological
risks. The company sells in many foreign markets between
Europe and Asia.</p>

    <img src="images/belhasa-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
  <p>This was followed by launching two companies, Ebtikar
Investment and Belhasa Crushers and Quarries Management
in 2003. Ebtikar was established to bring together the
Group’s interests in Iraq and in trading with Iraq within one
investment vehicle. It wide interests included trading, water
engineering, civil contracting, vehicle sales and servicing,
real estate, advertising, logistics and communications,
operating in Dubai, Baghdad, Erbil, Basra, Macedonia, Beirut
and Amman. As for Crushers and Quarries Management, it
only has a direct presence in the UAE but its products are
globally traded.</p>
<p>The Belhasa Group’s involvement in the construction,
technology, and petroleum sectors spans four decades. In
1977, Belhasa Engineering and Contracting Company was
set up and has subsequently become one of Dubai’s larger
construction companies. The company has undertaken a wide
range of construction projects across the region. The Group
has three other construction-related companies; namely Al
Tatweer Contracting, Belhasa Actioncrete International and
Belhasa Projects, plus a partnership wth Six Construct of
Belgium, manifested as BESIX.</p>
<p>In 2002, the group made its move in the technology sector
and gave the green light for Global Scan Technologies.</p>
<p>
    Belhasa’s engagement in the petroleum sector did not
begin until it established a specialized division in oil and gas in 2002 and was given the task to undertake a number of
major projects in the region.

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Other very well-known companies in the Group include
United Decoration – foremost in top quality interiors;
Emirates Driving Institute, Belhasa Trading and Development,
Belhasa Motors and other companies which operate in the
local market.</p>
<p>Moreover, Belhasa has engaged in the real estate and
investments sectors since 1997 when it established Belhasa
International Company L.L.C. to hold a substantial volume
of investment in industrial, commercial and agricultural
projects as well as to manage the various companies and
establishments in which it has interests. The company holds
numerous quoted and unquoted investments in local and
overseas entities.</p>
<p>Belhasa Travel and Tourism brings visitors from all over
the world to the UAE, in particular from China where Belhasa
has a fully established Beijing rep office for trading as well as
travel business.</p>
<p>The success of Belhasa International L.L.C. is attributed
to its good reputation for quality in all it undertakes, and
to its strong sense of continuity and excellent contacts. The
company has grown gradually, benefiting from the economic
growth of the region overall.</p>

   <b>Driving Jordan’s advancement in e-services</b>
        
<p>Smart Cube’s extensive portfolio in transportation and traffic encompasses a vast range of systems and applications
that help countries enhance their overall transportation and traffic systems. The mission of its services is always to
eliminate the complexity, effort and risk usually associated with manual mechanisms, providing numerous benefits
to both citizens and governments.</p>
<p>Two of its key projects executed in Jordan for its Drivers & Vehicles Licensing (DVLD) department of the Public
Security Directorate have brought about an advancement in the sector. The first one was a Technical Inspection
System that dispensed with the paper forms of the in all licensing centres at DVLD by replacing them with
electronic forms. It involved complete integration with the current central DVLD Vehicles Licensing System as
well as the use of new and advanced technologies including Samsung Galaxy Touch handheld devices, ensuring
faster inspection processes for people as well as integration with Euro Systems.</p>
<p>The second project involved developing a portal that provides an electronic content and services gateway for
citizens, residents, businesses, and the government, enabling them to access e-services and relevant information
for all DVLD operations. It provides DVLD with a reliable, full-feature Document Management System that
facilitates instant access of documents and guarantees security and authenticity of its files through electronic
storage. This led to substantial improvement in efficiency, security, time saving, and operational costs for the
department.</p>
<p>Many of Smart Cube systems, once deployed, have resulted in enhanced travel and transportation, vehicle control
and safety, travel time reliability, increased mobility and enhanced capacity in existing physical infrastructure.</p>

        <p>In the face of growing importance of digital access, global
media houses have adapted their strategy to create a
more inclusive experience for their audiences. However, the
younger crop of companies arriving in this field have begun
to emerge more successful by adapting from the start. Prime
among these, is the Abu Dhabi Media (ADM), a company
that places innovativeness and technology at the heart of its
business strategy, thereby emerging as a globally-respected
name in the field.</p>
<p>In a span of just over five years, ADM has made a name
for itself in diverse business sectors in the industry. It is
one of the fastest growing, multi-platform media and
entertainment organisations in the Middle East, operating
across the broadcast, publishing, and digital media sectors.</p>
<p>The company started off by launching the first Englishlanguage
daily newspaper out of Abu Dhabi, The National, in
August 2007 and soon branched out into almost every field
in the industry. Today, it manages over 20 market-leading
brands in two categories: brands that serve the UAE through
a defined public service role and brands that target the wider
Arab region and the world with clear commercial objectives.</p>
<p>As the only media company in the UAE with brands across
the entire spectrum of the industry, Abu Dhabi Media (AMD)
provides media that entertains, informs and educates both
the local community and the international audiences. Closer
to home, it has established prestigious local brands such as
daily newspapers Al Ittihad and The National, television and
radio stations Abu Dhabi Al Emarat TV, Abu Dhabi Sports TV,
Quran Kareem, Emarat FM, Abu Dhabi FM, Star FM, and the
children’s magazine Majid.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/admedia-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>The company also has channels exclusively geared
towards women and families with brands that reach across
the pan-Arab world. These include Abu Dhabi Al Oula TV,
leading women’s magazine Zahrat Al Khaleej, and online
platform anaZahra.com, as well as a suite of pay TV brands
and digital entities such as ADMCSport.com.</p>
Abu Dhabi Media owns and operates a number of
subsidiaries, including local film company, Image Nation Abu
Dhabi; LIVE, an outdoor broadcast and production company;
and state-of-the-art printing facility, United Printing Press
(UPP). In addition, the company partners with Universal
Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment on VEVO, the
premium online music video platform; and with National
Geographic on National Geographic Abu Dhabi, the Arabic language television channel, and National Geographic Al
Arabiya magazine.</div>
<p>Abu Dhabi Media has firmed several partnerships with
world-leading media groups to enhance its offerings
regionally and internationally. These continue to bring new
expertise and skills to the UAE, while opening up a dynamic
new market for the partners. Some of its partnerships have
resulted in striking new innovations in the global media
landscape. In 2009, with Universal Music Group and Sony
Music Entertainment, ADM launched VEVO - the region’s
leading premium music, video and entertainment service.</p>
<p>Another key example of its global ambitions is, Image
Nation, which since its launch in 2008, has rapidly become
one of the leading content creators in the UAE and beyond.
Image Nation Abu Dhabi, the company’s local division,
develops film, TV and documentary projects showcasing
Emirati talent both in front and behind the camera. It also
contributes to the film industry in Abu Dhabi through a
number of training and internship programs that encourage
the growth of local talent. Further on, drawing on the
group’s creative and marketing expertise, Image Nation Strategic Media Solutions works with partners to create
engaging content that enables their strategic and marketing
objectives.</p>

    <img src="images/admedia-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>ADM’s successful global film division, Image Nation
International maintains strategic partnerships with a
number of major producers and has brought forth several
critically- and commercially-acclaimed films. Its partners
include Participant Media, Hyde Park Entertainment, Parkes
/Macdonald Productions, Warner Bros., and Singapore’s
Media Development Authority (MDA). The division has coproduced
a number of feature films, including “The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel”, “The Help” and “Contagion” and
through its Parkes+MacDonald/Image Nation partnership
produced “Men in Black 3” and “Flight”. In early-2013, Hyde
Park Image Nation won an International Emmy Kids Award
for its co-production “Lost Christmas” earlier this month.</p>
<p>ADM, at present, is emerging as a unique Middle
Eastern brand unlike any other that not just brings relevant
international content to the region, while producing features
for the global market, but also creates unique, locallyfocused
content.</p>

        <p>InvestSource was established in 2010 by a young
UAE entrepreneur, Mohammed Al Hammadi. The
success of InvestSource began with being the first Dubaibased
Investment Promotion and Business Intelligence
Consultancy Firm that works with countries and regions
willing to promote their investment climate and attract
investments from the GCC - some of the wealthiest capital
sourcing markets in the world.</p>


<div id="co_img">

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Within a few months of operation, the company has
succeeded in developing unique products like the “Why
UAE?” investment promotion package and the “Highflyers”
initiative in 2010. Why UAE? became renown as the official
investment and doing business guide for the UAE. Due to the
positive feedbacks received from the different parts of the
world, the publication was translated to different languages
such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian and French.</p>

    <p>It is also important to demonstrate the importance of the
“Highflyers” initiative launched by InvestSource in 2010. The
Highflyers documented success stories of 110 UAE-based
investors that succeeded to export its successes beyond the
UAE borders. The initiative has achieved a dramatic feedback
received from different countries and organizations. Both
publications played vital roles as marketing tools that
contributed to the expansion of the company. Several
Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) approached the company after the launch of these important promotion
tools.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/insource-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->

	<p>This signaled the company’s expansion start in the field
of investment promotion. In 2011, InvestSource has gone
international when it was commissioned by the Armenian
Development Agency to conduct a thorough research about GCC tourists’ behavior. Since then, the company
began to extend its products offering by adding managing
promotional events called the “Why Event”, developing
promotional packages known as the “Why Package” and
specific industry reports termed as “InvestAssist”.</p>

        <p>The journey of success of e-home automation initiative
began in 1999 when Khalifa Al Jaziri, a young UAE
entrepreneur and a co-founder of the company, received an
email in his (Junk Mailbox) about the new concept known
as smart homes. Khalifa did not treat that email as we all
would do. He read it and believed on that concept and its
applicability in the region. Thus, he decided (along with his
brother Ahmad) to take action by establishing a company in
2003 that provides home automation systems – the first of
its kind in the region. Since this was a relatively new concept
here, Khalifa began attending a variety of conferences
and exhibitions to disseminate the idea of his business and
started automating houses of his family, relatives and friends
to gain practical experience and proving the success of this
model.</p>
<p>The increasing demand for these solutions required the
search for products that are tailored for the region since most
of them were UK and USA-customized. Thus, establishing an
R&D unit in the UK to develop the company’s own software
and a unit in China to develop its own hardware came as a
strong indication of the company’s vision of becoming a
leading e-home technologies provider in the Middle East.
This has given the company the ability not only to provide
customized solutions for the UAE but also for other markets
like MENA, Levant and CIS.</p>

<p>In-house tailored systems for home automation allow
a variety of interfaces, including Windows Media Center,
voice control and smartphones the control of audio and
video equipment, lighting, heating, ventilation and air
conditioning, motorized curtains and irrigation systems
around the property as well as home security. Simply, it
became possible to communicate with the property through
a mobile, computer or voice commands without the need to
be present.</p> 
<p>Within a few years of operation, e-Home Automation
has significantly grown from two employees to more than
100 employees, from one office in Dubai to seven offices in
UK, China, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt. The company
developed its own corporate governance without even knowing the existence of such a term at the beginning. It
also expanded its product base to include solutions like
e-Masjid, e-office and e-health center.</p>
<p>Indeed, the journey of this company’s success was not an
easy ride. But thanks to those who listen and appreciate the
entrepreneurial spirit – the top with no doubt is H.H. Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rashid represented by Mohammed bin
Rashid Establishment for SME Development that was there
to help in every step of the company’s growth.</p>

awards including the best business in both IT and Electronics
sectors in the Mohammed Bin Rashid Small and Medium
Enterprise Awards for Young Business Leaders ceremony and
the best SME in the UAE which is at the GCC level.</p>

   <b>Automating homes around the region</b>
        
<p>The number of home automation companies has
exponentially grown in the last five years in the GCC.
This is mainly due to the increasing advancements
in smart phone technologies and people’s demand
asking for “modern lifestyle” houses. However,
through its own R&D unit, the company has been
able to offer tailored solutions that are more suitable
to the regional uses. Thus, e-home automation has
succeeded to position itself as an innovative e-home
technologies provider rather than a mere distributor
of others’ solutions.</p>
<p>As a result, e-Home Automation has established
an incredible track record of projects not only in
the UAE but also around the GCC region. Entering
the Saudi market in 2008 was a very important
move that gave the company an access to around
28 million people. In addition, opening a branch in
Yarmouk, Kuwait contributed to the growth of the
company’s success and reputation.</p>
