        <p>In the GCC region, populated by expatriates from several
        nations, money remittance has been of paramount
        importance not just in terms of reliability for consumer,
        but also for regulators. In the UAE, outward remittances
        by expatriates as well as inward receipts of funds have
        consistently recorded strong growth over the years. In a
        sector that has seen plenty of innovations and growing
        competition, UAE Exchange stands tall as a beacon of
        success, integrity and commitment on an international scale.</p>
       <p> The story of this brand began over 30 years with the aim
        to be a pioneer in recognising the opportunities that the then
        young UAE put forth as a nation that welcomed ambitious,
        hard-working migrant populations from across the world.
        Today, UAE Exchange is a leading global money transfer
        and foreign exchange brand that is trusted by millions of
        customers and partners globally.</p>
       <p> Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, UAE Exchange has as its
        core the aim to be the people’s brand known for quality
        and customer-centric approach. This approach has reaped
        results in large numbers with the name today enjoying the
        trust of over 3.5 million registered customers worldwide. On
        the operational front its presence comprises close to 650
        direct offices of its own in 30 countries across five continents,
        making it the only brand in the segment to own a global
        network of this magnitude. Additionally, UAE Exchange continues 
        to strengthen this with correspondent banking
        relationship that stands at more than 150 global banks and
        growing at an exponential rate.</p>

        <p>The journey of this extremely successful conglomerate
        from the UAE started with a humble branch in Abu Dhabi in
        October 1980. Within just over a decade, it consolidated its
        UAE country operations as the market leader. Not one to rest
        on its laurels, it started out on the path of global expansion
        by establishing a market presence in Kuwait, Oman and India 
        in the ‘90s in quick succession. Along the way it added
        several firsts to its name, prominent among these was the
        first exchange house to get the coveted SWIFT membership.
        UAE Exchange is also the leading agent for Xpress Money
        and Western Union, the most popular instant money transfer
        options.</p> 
        <p>One of the hallmarks of its progress has been the ability to
        embrace new technologies and innovations. As a brand that
        is driven by the vision of the UAE’s leadership, the company was 
        highly foresighted in spotting the opportunities in the
        online world. It was a result of this that way back in the year
        1998 UAE Exchange launched its global website with online
        facility to track transactions. It has always relied on homegrown
        technology and support system for added reliability.
        Further on, centralised dealing with Cash Processing Centre
        (CPC) handling multiple currencies optimal control and
        security.</p>
        <p>The company has one of the most diversified product
        ranges in the industry that spans both physical and virtual
        options. Its offerings include many unique products and
        service like Xpress Money, the global instant money transfer
        brand; Money2anywhere, the instant money transfer portal;
        Smart Pay, the WPS-compliant industry-leading payroll
        solution; and FlashRemit, the product for real time account
        credit; among others.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    	<p>With an eye on international opportunities in global
        instant money transfer, it formed Xpress Money, a UAE
        Exchange associate, in the UK. This brand has grown to form
        an agent network spread across 125 countries in 5 different
        continents with over 135,000 agent locations.</p>
        <p>In the online sphere, Money2anywhere is its highly
        popular portal that offers online remittance experience
        with a combination of competitive exchange rates, quick
        processing of the remittance request and a friendly customer
        service team. This portal currently offers direct transfers to
        over 150 Banks in more than 30 countries as well as cash
        payout at over 100,000 locations across the globe.</p>
       <p> Keeping its customers first and to empower salary earners
        through organised salary payments, it brought forth Smart
        Pay, a WPS-compliant payroll solution, enabling convenient,
        timely and secure salary pickup through the branches of UAE
        Exchange in the UAE.</p>
        <p>Another pioneering product from the UAE Exchange
        stable is FlashRemit that enables real time account credit of
        cash, which is a unique product of its kind, remitting cash in
        bank accounts in real-time.</p>
        <p>The conglomerate has placed focus on creating sustained
        growth in revenue and profitability, whilst serving the society
        in an environment of mutual trust and transparency. UAE
        Exchange has always been at the forefront of technology
        right from multi-language electronic kiosks at branches,
        PDAs and online payment systems to proprietary software
        platforms like XCQ, XM and XTT. Furthermore, in its quest
        to support regulators globally, it utilised the customer
        registration process to ensure high standards of Anti-money
        laundering & Combating Terrorist Financing (AML&CTF)
        compliance. The company also encourages active lifestyle
        with participations in corporate sport events and supports the
        community by organising blood donation and environmental
        clean-up drives.</p>

    <img src="images/uaex-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
        <p>Along the way, the brand has been conferred several
        prestigious awards and commendations including the
        Bizz 2012 Award by WORLDCOB (World Confederation of
        Business); ENDP Best Partner Award 2007; USD & EUR STP
        Excellence Award from Deutsche Bank 2007; MRM Business
        Award 2007; Sheikh Khalifa Excellence Award (SKEA) 2009;
        and Emiratisation Award (HRDA) 2009.</p>
        <p>As a brand that continues to have immense growth
        potential, in spite of an expansive presence, UAE Exchange
        has set its eyes on farther horizons. With an eye on future
        expansion, Centurion Investment, an Abu Dhabi-based
        company, acquired 40 per cent of UAE Exchange in February 
        2012 as part of a drive to expand the brand’s businesses
        into the financial sector. This move marked the first step
        in UAE Exchange’s aim to go beyond money transfer into
        other financial sectors to bring home more benefits to its
        audiences. The company recently opened its state-of-theart
        Global Contact Centre spread out over 15000 sq. ft. and
        housing 300 professionals, who address customer queries
        round-the-clock.</p>

   <b>Darting forward in the USA</b>
        
        <p>It is uncommon for a consumer financial services
        brand from the region to go on to mark a
        formidable presence in almost every part of the
        world. More so in highly developed economies,
        where the new entrants face high competition
        from established players.</p>
       <p> UAE Exchange took this challenge head on in the
        year 2000 by establishing its associate MoneyDart
        Global Services Inc. as a remittance and foreign
        exchange brand. It started out by reaching out
        to a wide customer base across the country and
        bringing you a wide array of products and services
        under a single roof with several value-added allied
        services.</p>
       <p> Within just a few years, MoneyDart, also known
        as UAE Exchange USA, became a vital link in the
        strong worldwide UAE Exchange network, while
        providing quality service with the same degree
        of attention to every customer. Today, it has a
        network of nine branches across the country, a
        testament to the trust and loyalty that it enjoys
        from its customers, including expatriates, from
        various communities.</p>

   <b>Global exchange and remittance standards in Malaysia</b>
        
        <p>Malaysia, as a fast-developing nation, is home
        to millions of expatriates from various parts of
        the world. Additionally, the expansive business
        and trading presence in the nation, offered
        good prospects in the financial sector locally for
        remittance and local foreign exchange needs.</p>
       <p>UAE Exchange sensed the opportunity to
        bring its high quality of service and trust as the
        leading global remittance and foreign exchange
        brand. It did so in the year 2011 through the
        strategic move of acquiring Fast Remit Sdn Bhd,
        which was renamed as UAE Exchange Malaysia
        Sdn Bhd. By joining hands with and bringing
        an established Malaysian company into its fold,
        UAE Exchange benefited from its vast local
        know-how, which also complemented its global
        standards.</p>
       <p>Its success was evidence by the quick expansion
        and growth with the exchange opening its
        eighth branch in Malaysia in 2012, the year that
        marked the 32nd anniversary of UAE Exchange
        global operations. Aside from Malaysia, UAE
        Exchange also celebrated this anniversary
        by expanding its international presence into
        Germany and Zambia.</p>

   <b>Standing up for UNICEF</b>
        
        <p>UAE Exchange matches its global presence with its social commitments, which have been instrumental in bringing
aid to those affected due to natural disasters and other social issues. In the year 2012, during the holy month of
Ramadan, it partnered yet again with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for a campaign to benefit
underprivileged children. The company donated a total of USD 100,000 for the cause. This was the second year of
this campaign with UAE Exchange expanding it to five countries in the region. The contribution was sourced from
every remittance transactions sent through its branches in the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, without
levying any extra charge on the customers.</p>

   <b>gocash – Empowering customers
to ‘travel smart’</b>
        
        <p>In the year 2012, keeping up with its aim to consistently
        innovate in the field of financial services globally,
        UAE Exchange launched gocash, the world’s first sixcurrency
        prepaid travel card, powered by MasterCard.
        This card offers travellers unique advantages globally
        that include exchange rate lock facility, which

        the freedom to do purchases, worldwide, across 32
        million merchant locations and 1.5 million ATMs, where
        MasterCard is accepted.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the card can also be used for online
        purchases and makes budgeting travel much easier
        as the user can load and spend only what is needed.
        Moreover, gocash can be easily acquired and reloaded

        <p>Emirates NBD was formed on 16 October 2007 as
        a result of the merger between Emirates Bank
        International (EBI) and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD).
        This merger became a regional consolidation blueprint for
        the banking and finance sector as it combined the second
        and fourth largest banks in the United Arab Emirates to
        form a banking champion with an asset base summing up
        to AED 305.4 billion as at 30 September 2012, capable of
        delivering enhanced value across corporate, retail, Islamic
        and investment banking throughout the Gulf Cooperation
        Council (GCC) region.</p>
        <p>The UAE’s trade policy, the tax-free system, the active
        import and export sector, the conducive transport facilities
        are among the main factors that not only created valuable
        trade-financing opportunities for Emirates NBD but also
        enabled it to expand at a fast pace in the region.</p>
        <p>In 2000, Legacy Emirates Bank had implemented an
        international expansion strategy which was initiated with
        the opening of a representative office in India. Since then,
        the bank had continued expanding into the Asian Continent
        with a representative office in Iran in 2003. The following year witnessed a unique regional achievement when Emirates
        Bank became the first foreign bank to operate in Saudi
        Arabia. Being the only bank with a presence in both UAE
        and KSA which represents over 75% of the GCC’s GDP gave
        Emirates Bank a unique marketing advantage. In 2006, the
        bank enhanced its presence in Asia with a representative
        office in Singapore, committing itself to its well-planned
        expansion strategy.</p>

        <p>After the merger with the National Bank of Dubai in 2007,
        Emirates NBD reconfirmed the International Strategy and
        first steps were upgrading Singapore Office to a branch and
        opening a branch in Qatar in 2008. The bank has also stepped
        into the Chinese market by opening a representative office in
        Beijing in September 2012.
        Emirates NBD’s strong Investment, Retail and Private
        Banking Services, coupled with leadership in Asset
        Management products, has enabled the group to deliver
        outstanding value to its shareholders, customers and
        employees. In 2012, Emirates NBD won the “Best Bank in
        UAE” Award for the ninth consecutive year as well as “Best
        Trade Finance Bank in UAE” and “Best Foreign Exchange
        Provider in the UAE” for several years from the prestigious
        magazine “Global Finance”.</p>

        <p>In addition to being rated amongst the 50 top regional
        companies in the Hawkamah ESG Pan Arab Index and
        topping the ‘Brand Simplicity Index’ as the region’s No.1
        Retail Banking Brand, Emirates NBD has recently won
        several awards, including the ‘Dubai Award for Sustainable
        Transport’, ‘Specialist Fund of the Year’ at the 2012 MENA Fund Manager Performance Awards for its Emirates Global Sukuk Fund, ‘Best Private Sector Customer Service Initiative’
        and ‘Best Large Bank: Service Quality’ at the 2011 Bank
        Benchmarking Index Award and “Best Customer Attraction”,
        “Best Online Experience”, “Best Customer Impressions and
        Interactions” and “Best Overall Customer Experience” at the
        Customer360ME Summit and Awards 2012.</p>
        <p>Emirates NBD also won “Best Corporate Card Product –
        Smart Card Awards Middle East” and “Best Bank Brand” and
        award for leading PR and marketing company and ‘Best

   <b>Targeting dynamic economic region</b>
        
        <p>In line with its expansion strategy into Asia, Emirates NBD upgraded its Singapore representative office to a branch in 2010 and launched its representative office in Beijing in September 2012. This impressive entry will not only explore opportunities in Singapore and China but it will also give the bank access to strong emerging markets where the potential of growth is high.</p>
        <p>Singapore and China’s strategic location and established reputation as well as being important trading partners with the UAE were behind the logical decision of choosing these two dynamic and leading countries. The Beijing Representative Office’s initial offering includes market research and liaison services and works with customers
        across both regions to provide all the necessary support. The office also works closely with Singapore branch covering the Asia pacific region to capture the significant Intra - Asian trade and investment flows. The Singapore branch focuses on wealth management, targeting High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) from the Middle East who
 would like to base part of their offshore assets in Singapore. On the other hand, it promotes MENA (Middle East North Africa) investments to Asian High Net Worth Individuals who are currently under-weighted in their MENA exposure.</p>

        <p>As a regional hub for trade and economy, UAE and its
        capital Abu Dhabi, provide the companies based here
        a significant competitive advantage to grow. Inspired by the
        diversification policies and prudent economic policies of the
        nation, several UAE-based financial brands have risen to
        become prominent players on just the regional sphere, but
        also the global stage.</p>
      <p>  One name that has been consistently makes waves both
        in the UAE and beyond for over four decades is the National
        Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the number one bank in the UAE.
        It was incorporated in 1968 and is listed on the Abu Dhabi
        Securities Exchange (ADX). </p>
      <p>  It is a brand whose growth has mirrored the phenomenal
        emergence of the UAE as a regional hub for trade, commerce
        and tourism. Stepping up to match the nation’s rapidly
        increasing banking needs required, the Bank took a
        comprehensive approach to offering banking and financial
        services for all. NBAD did this with a wide variety of financial 
        services for both the consumer and corporate markets,
        ensuring that the needs of a fast-growing populace and
        businesses were met. Additionally, it also branched out
        to offer a range of services including fund management,
        Islamic finance, brokerage, financial market services, leasing,
        property management and private banking.</p>

        <p>NBAD set its sights on financial sectors globally by opening
        its first overseas branch in 1975. Ever since then, NBAD has
        continued to expand its international presence. Choosing
        its international market through well-researched steps, it
        marked a presence in some of the most promising hubs
        in each region. Having set strong foundations in the UAE,
        NBAD grew at a steady pace and expanded strategically to
        seize opportunities in established and emerging markets
        globally.</p>
        <p>This strategy has proven to be successful in every possible
        way with NBAD’s expanding global network now spanning
        across four continents from Shanghai- China, Hong Kong and
        Malaysia in the Far East to Oman, UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain
        in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); Jordan in the Levant;
        Egypt, Sudan and Libya in Africa; Switzerland, France and
        the UK in Europe, and the United States in North America.
        The Bank has also expansion plan which include Lebanon,
        Iraq, India, South Sudan and other key destinations in the
        MENA region and beyond.</p>
        <p>Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, the Bank is structured into
        various client-focused divisions such as domestic banking,
        international banking, financial markets and corporate and
        investment banking. Some of the Bank’s specialised entities
        are global wealth, comprising of private banking and the
        asset management group, and the wholly-owned stock
        brokerage company, Abu Dhabi Financial Services (ADFS).</p> 
        <p>Its other subsidiaries, Abu Dhabi National Leasing
        Company (ADNL) and Abu Dhabi National Properties
        (ADNP), are grouped under the corporate and investment
        banking division. Complementing the bank’s mainstream
        offerings, its Islamic division venture, Abu Dhabi National
        Islamic Finance (ADNIF), offers Sharia’a-compliant products
        and services.</p>

         <p>At present, its international operations span 15 countries
        on four continents with nearly 55 branches and 60 ATMs
        overseas, making it the leading UAE bank in terms of
        international presence. At home, the bank has a network of
        more than 125 branches and over 566 ATMs.</p>
       <p> Ranked as one of the top 50 safest banks in the world
        and the safest bank in the Middle East, NBAD is the UAE’s
        most profitable bank and also has the highest market
        capitalisation. In 2010, NBAD became the first UAE Bank
        to earn more than US$1 billion in net profits. In 2011, NBAD
        was named best bank in the UAE by Euromoney for the third
        consecutive year and fifth time in the last decade.
        NBAD is currently rated senior long-term/short-term A+/
        A-1 by Standard and Poor’s, Aa3/P1 by Moody’s and AA-/F1+
        by Fitch giving it one of the strongest combined rating of any
        Middle Eastern financial institution.</p>
       <p> As a socially-responsible banking group, NBAD is also a
        key role model in the social and environmental development
        of the UAE. Continuing its many pioneering initiatives, NBAD
        Trust Company (Jersey) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary
        of the group, recently launched Wealth Builder Plan, the first
        pension scheme for expatriates by a UAE bank. Building on
        its many successes, the bank aims to be the leader in the
        Arab world by providing services that are relevant and in line
        with international standards.</p>

   <b>Bridging culture with new age financial excellence in Switzerland</b>
        
        <p>One of NBAD痴 unique achievements came when it
        combined the highest standard of Swiss Private Banking
        services with an unrivalled understanding of Arabian
        culture. In order to meet the needs of the growing
        wealth in the region and beyond, NBAD Private Bank
        (Suisse) SA was launched in June 2007 to offer full
        private banking services aided by local private teams in
        the UAE and in locations where NBAD operates.</p>
       <p> The aim of this move was to provide customised banking
        and wealth management for discerning high-net-worth
        individuals through an in-depth understanding of the
        modern financial world and Arabian culture. Located
        in Geneva, it is wholly-owned by the NBAD Group,
        yet independent and fully subject to Swiss rules and

        <p>The modern banking industry in the region is just a
few decades old, but has already seen phenomenal
innovation in practices and expansion in operations. Among
the behemoths in this field is the Abu Dhabi Commercial
Bank (ADCB), which was established in the year 1985 when
Federal Commercial Bank, the Khaleej Commercial Bank
and the Emirates Commercial Bank merged into one bank.
Buoyed by this combining of strengths, over the span of
three decades, ADCB has grown its assets and its operations
substantially to become one of the largest banking
corporations in the UAE.</p>
<p>ADCB stands tall as the third largest bank in the UAE and
the second largest in Abu Dhabi by assets. Operation-wise,
ADCB works in the fields of Consumer and Corporate banking,
Islamic Banking, Trade Finance, Structured Finance, Foreign
Exchange, Derivatives, Fund Management and Financial
Advisory Services. Furthermore, the bank has another
dedicated subsidiary for Islamic banking financial solutions
named Abu Dhabi Commercial Islamic Finance PJSC.</p>
	
<p>ADCB is owned 58.08% by the Abu Dhabi Government
through the Abu Dhabi Investment Council. Its shares are
traded on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange with authorised and issued share capital of AED 5.595 billion. Although
indirectly owned by the Abu Dhabi Government, it has
established a successful track of commercially competitive
banking business. The bank believes its strong market share
and franchise, reflecting its large and loyal customer-base,
are its major competitive strengths in the retail business.
As for investment banking, ADCB keenly utilises its deep
knowledge and understanding of what customers really
want and need in order to position itself as the UAE’s most
modernised and service-orientated Bank.</p>

    <img src="images/adcb-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	

<p>As part of its strategic approach to further strengthen its
retail portfolio, ADCB became the first local bank in the UAE
to acquire an international bank’s local franchise by acquiring
the local operations of RBS; Royal Bank of Scotland in June
2010. This moved added over 250,000 retail customers to
ADCB’s fast-growing client base, in addition to 51 ATMs,
three new branches and two customer service centres, along
with a world-class operations processing and modern call
centre facility based in Dubai.</p>
<p>ADCB’s current operational structure includes the
Wholesale Banking Group; comprising Business Banking,
Cash Management, Trade Finance, Corporate Finance,
Investment Banking, Indian Operations, Infrastructure and
Strategic Client Operations; the Consumer Banking Group,
which comprises Consumer, Retail, Wealth Management and
Islamic Operations. In addition, ADCB’s subsidiary Abu Dhabi
Commercial Properties takes care of the bank’s Real Estate
Management and Service Operations.</p> 
<p>As part of Abu Dhabi’s philosophy of sustainable growth,
ADCB developed its own strategy to sustain long-term
growth through diversification of its business model and
improvement of operational effectiveness as well as
expansion of operations to new specialties and countries. In fact, ADCB’s international expansion strategy comprises
three wings, namely direct investment, acquisitions and
joint ventures. Currently, the bank has two fully operational
branches in India. In order to gain insights into the growing
Asian market, ADCB acquired a 25 Percent stake in RHB
Capital Berhad In May 2008, a leading Malaysian financial
services group, owning one of the country’s largest banks
along with other financial services businesses. Having
expanded the brand’s presence further, ADCB sold this stake
in 2011 to an Abu Dhabi-based investment conglomerate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bank had also formed two joint
ventures with Australia’s Macquarie Bank, one focused on
Infrastructure Fund Management and the other provided
Interest Rate, Currency and Commodity Derivatives products
to clients in the GCC region. In early 2010, ADCB extended its
partnership portfolio to Switzerland where the bank formed
an alliance with Schroder and Co. Bank to offer private
banking and wealth management services to UAE clients out
of Switzerland.</p>

    <p>ADCB has consistently won laurels for its achievement,
the recent ones among these include top ranking of the
Middle East 2012 KW Digital Webranking survey and the
Bank of the Year Award – UAE at ‘The Banker’s Bank of the
Year Awards 2012’.</p>
<p>The figures it continues to achieve signal the bank’s
continued success on a phenomenal scale. As at 30
September 2012, ADCB employed over 3,600 people from
54 nationalities, serving approximately 470,000 retail
customers and over 36,000 wholesale clients in 49 branches,
four pay offices in the UAE and two branches in India and
one branch in Jersey. Its assets stood AED 182 billion as on
30 September 2012.</p>

   <b>Making a mark in the Indian market</b>
        
<p>ADCB initiated its operations in India with the objective of
further developing Indo-UAE trade relations and catering
to the remittance and savings needs of the Non-resident
Indians (NRIs) working in the UAE and other countries in
the GCC region.</p>
<p>The Indian operations of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
(ADCB) date back to 1980, when the former ‘Emirates
Commercial Bank’ was set up on December 9, 1980.
ADCB’s business philosophy encourages the bank to
always look for new opportunities and identify strategic
niches in untapped markets particularly in locations
with strong fundamentals and promising growth trends
like India. Embracing such a progressive and innovative
approach enabled ADCB to gain a strong foot-hold among
the many global players rushing to be a part of the coming
renaissance in India.</p>
<p>The India operations of ADCB are organised into three
business segments: Liabilities, Corporate Banking and
Trade Finance (CTF), and Treasury. Over the last 30 years,
ADCB has been in India serving these ‘niche’ segments.
As part of its expansion plans, its Bengaluru branch was
set up and opened in 1996, thereby complementing its
presence in the financial capital of Mumbai.</p>

        <p>Islamic banking is synonymous with approach that
balances fairness with financial prudence. In the MENA
region, UAE has been leading the way in modernising this
field to adapt to changing economic realities while preserving
the values of Sharia’a.</p>
<p>Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) has at the forefront in the UAE
for over three decades and today is a familiar name in the
financial sector in the region and beyond. Established in
1975, DIB is the first Islamic bank to have incorporated the
principles of Islam in all its practices and is the largest Islamic
bank in the UAE and third globally.</p>
<p>As of 2011, the global Islamic finance services industry
comprising more than 400 financial institutions was valued
at over USD 1.35 trillion and Dubai Islamic Bank continues
to work towards expanding its values to the advantage of
communities around the world. Its growth is in line with the
recent aim set by Dubai to become the “global capital” of the
Islamic economy as the emirate looks to boost this industry,
whilst further diversifying its economic base. The bank
currently operates 75 branches in the UAE and is listed on the
Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>

<p>DIB has been proactive in creating partnerships and
alliances at both the local and international level. Among its
key international presences is DIB Pakistan Limited, a wholly
owned subsidiary which has a network of 93 branches across
30 major cities in Pakistan. DIB also started operations in
Jordan, with the establishment of Jordan Dubai Islamic Bank.
Another one of its international successes is the Bank of
Khartoum (BoK), which is currently the largest bank in Sudan.
Deyaar, its real estate arm and Tamweel, the leading
home finance provider in the UAE continue to take the bank’s
success further. DIB’s other subsidiaries include DIB Capital and Dar Al Sharia Legal and Financial Consultancy (DAS).</p>
<p>Showcasing its keen understanding of regional
requirements, the bank launched Johara in the year 2002,
the first tailored banking services for women in the UAE and
in the global Islamic financial industrial at large. Among its
other innovations is the first mobile SMS messaging service in
Arabic as well as the Shaatir Savings account, created to help
children understand financial responsibility from an early age.
Alongside its accomplishments as a commercial organisation,
DIB has always recognised its wider role in society. The bank
supports the communities in which it operates through the DIB
Foundation, a non-profit social, humanitarian and charitable
organisation which distributes millions of dirhams to good
causes at home and abroad each year.</p>
<p>DIB has earned the respect of its peers around the world
for many years, and its leading position has been reaffirmed
by the 92 local, regional and international accolades that it
has won between 2008 and 2012. DIB has won awards across
diversified areas, including retail, corporate and investment
banking, as well as CSR and consultancy services. The bank’s
most recent awards include being named “Best Islamic Bank,
UAE” by World Finance and Banker Middle East magazines, “Best Distance Banking Service” (Electronic Banking Services)
by Banker Middle East, and being named among The Banker’s
“Deals of the Year for 2012”.</p>

    <p> Among its subsidiaries, Dar Al Sharia Legal and Financial
Consultancy (DAS), Dubai Islamic Bank’s (DIB) Sharia
consultancy and advisory subsidiary, was named the ‘Best
Sharia Advisory Firm’ for the second consecutive year at
the Mediterranean Awards for Global Excellence in Islamic
Finance. This recognition highlighted DAS’s track record of
advising on some of the most successful Sukuk transactions
in the Islamic finance sector during 2012.</p>
<p>DIB continues to grow at a sturdy pace with net profits
of AED 854 million for the first three quarters of 2012 and
total assets at AED 93.7 billion as compared to AED 90.6
billion in 2011. Today, the bank remains true to its roots as a
customer-centred organisation where close personal service
and understanding form the basis of all its relationships. DIB
is a bank that aims to the most progressive in Islamic banking
in the world by keeping the values of morality, equality and
transparency at the forefront in everything it does. The entity
derives its strength by reflecting the modernity, diversity and
balanced growth of the city whose name it shares.</p>

   <b>Leading with Islamic banking in Sudan</b>
        
<p>Among the North African states, Sudan has been one of the fastest growing economies not just in the region, but
globally. Identifying the opportunity for applying its proven expertise in Islamic banking, DIB took a strategic stake
in Bank of Khatoum (BoK) totalling 60% of the Government’s shares in the bank.</p>
<p>DIB undertook this move with the commitment to invest in BoK’s human, financial and technological resources for
the rapid development of the Bank. Over the past few years, DIB played a key role in enhancing the bank’s core
businesses of short-term and medium-term investments, corporate banking and retail banking with an emphasis
on modernised Sharia’a practices. Two of the key achievements during this period were the public subscription
of BoK’s shares on the Khartoum Stock Exchange and cross-listing with Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and the
merger with Emirates and Sudan Bank under the BoK brand name, making it the largest bank in the Sudan.</p>
<p>Today, BoK under Dubai Islamic Bank’s (DIB) management draws on the experience of seasoned professionals in
the various fields of banking encouraging a culture of innovation and total customer satisfaction across With 17
branches in the capital and 33 branches nationwide.</p>

        <p>The UAE has defined itself as a travel, business and
financial hub with an access to a diversified economy.
As a central point for world trade and commerce, the nation’s
solid infrastructure and technological advancement has
resulted in vast development across various sectors. Long
before UAE became a global business hub, Mashreq was
incepted as the Bank of Oman in Dubai, in 1967.</p>
<p>Over 45 years, the bank has grown to its current position
as one of the leading financial institutions, mirroring the
growth of the nation, while becoming a key catalyst in the
region’s progress. The bank played a pioneering role in the
industry, particularly in retail banking and among its many
firsts are the launch of significant products like travelers’
cheques, credit cards and ATMs.</p>
<p>As a leading financial Institution in the UAE, Mashreq aims
to be world-class in every facet of its business, including its
social responsibility to the community it serves. Towards
this goal, the bank pays particular attention to recruiting,
training, developing and retaining UAE National employees.
Its overall vision is to provide our customers the most
rewarding banking relationships through determination and
commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of excellence.</p>

	<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/mashreq-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>The desire to expand globally was a natural corollary of
its success and it embarked on its global journey in 1978
with branches in Egypt, Pakistan, London and Hong Kong
and continues to reach to farther shores. The evolution
of Dubai over the period, from a small trading port to its
current position as a major commercial hub, helped Mashreq
substantially in getting due recognition in overseas markets.</p>
<p>Today, the bank has an extensive network in UAE and it
can be gauged by the fact that one in every two households in the UAE banks with it. Its overseas presence comprises
26 offices in 11 countries spread across Europe, USA, Asia
and Africa, providing a comprehensive range of international
financial services.</p>
<p>Mashreq now virtually covers the globe, spanning 13 time
zones from New York in the west to Hong Kong in the Far East.
It is also a major provider of correspondent banking services
in money centres like New York, London and Hong Kong with
more than 1100 banks from over 70 countries banking with
Mashreq. Its ambition is to be recognised as the most viable
alternative to multinational banks by offering best-in-class
regional solutions such as its Global Transaction Services
platform (GTS) that provides it the competitive edge.</p>
<p>Mashreq has received numerous international awards
reflecting the bank’s successful record, such as the ‘Best
Regional Consumer Internet Bank for Online Deposit, Credit
and Investment Product offerings’ by Global Finance Best
Internet Bank Awards 2012 and the Best Islamic Investment
Fund Award for Mashreq Al Islami Income Fund from Banker
Middle East Product Awards 2012.</p>
<p>The bank has also been awarded the ISO 9001:2008
Certification by the British Standards Institute (BSI) for its
Operations Group. It also won three top awards at the MENA Fund Manager 2011 Performance Awards. Recently, Mashreq
was part of an arranged structured facility of USD 175 Million
for the state-owned carrier Sri Lankan Airlines.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/mashreq-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Over the past four decades, Mashreq has been consistently
ahead of the competition in the development of new products
and services, whether in foreign trade services, direct banking
or comprehensive mortgage products. Innovation is a major
factor that underscores all Mashreq products and services.
Continuing this approach, in 2012, Mashreq became the
first UAE bank to launch Renminbi (RMB) account services
to facilitate commercial contracts in this currency from the
UAE. The bank also continually enhances its CSR programme,
which is managed by its CSR & Internal Communications
Unit, supported by the Emiratisation HR Unit & UAE National
Learning & Development Unit.</p>
<p>Rising market share, solid equity base, growing asset
base and return on assets reflects on Mashreq’s strong
financial position in the market. In recent years, its
financial performance has grown from strength to strength,
registering new highs, as its operations have expanded. The
bank reported a net profit of AED 1.3 billion for the year
ended 31 December 2012, constituting a phenomenal 60%
increase on the previous year.</p>

   <b>Expanding innovative banking in the MENA region</b>
        
<p>Starting in 2009, Mashreq’s formed its International Banking Group to steer its international growth strategy in
order to grow banking services in select countries as well as to connect the region financially. This move leveraged
the existing footprint and grew Mashreq’s regional network by expanding into select markets such as Kuwait and
Bahrain.</p>
<p>Building on its earlier successes, Mashreq launched operations in Kuwait, retail banking in Egypt with 10 branches
and moved to an onshore license in Bahrain. Furthermore, it also integrated its Financial Institutions franchise with
the international commercial banking business. As a result of these efforts Mashreq was awarded “Best Regional
Retail Bank” and “Best Trade Bank in the Middle East” for the year 2012.</p>
<p>Currently, the bank is a sizable player in both corporate and retail segments in the promising and fast-growing
markets of Qatar, Egypt, Bahrain and Kuwait and has established itself as a pioneering name in global banking
from the region.</p>

        <p>In the banking sector, achieving financial success while
marking a formidable overseas presence requires
several decades of experience. An exception to this trend is
Al Hilal Bank, which stemmed from the idea to establish an
Islamic bank that would redefine the industry. It managed
to raise the expectations of corporate and personal banking
customers, and set the bar high for innovation, the use of
technology and a fresh banking experience within a span of
just over five years.</p>
<p>Al Hilal Bank was incorporated in Abu Dhabi on 18 June
2007 by through a Royal Decree and was established by
the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, an investment arm of
the Government of Abu Dhabi. It began with an authorized
capital of AED 4 billion and a paid up capital of AED 2 billion.
The bank’s paid up share capital stands at AED 2.59 billion as
of July 2012.</p>
<p>The bank formally opened its first four branches in the
UAE on June 19, 2008 with a commitment to being known as
a progressive Islamic bank and an innovative industry leader.
From thereon, it has benefited immensely from the UAE’s
well-established financial industry, steering its ambitions to
the goals set in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030.</p>

    <img src="images/hilalbank-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
	
	
<p>In keeping with the bank’s goals of principled innovation
and development in the Islamic banking world, it re-engineers
and enhances generic Islamic structures to accommodate
customers’ needs for original, unique financing solutions,
restructuring proposals and hybrid arrangements. Al Hilal’s
unique approach to Islamic financial services is matched with
innovations in almost every aspect.</p>
<p>Some of its unique achievement include: eGrab - world’s first emissionless mobile bank, UAE’s first Instantly issued
Visa Debit Cards with a personalised account number, UAE’s
first thumb verification system for banking transactions; first
use of digital pens for banking transactions in the Middle
East; Money Station –Middle East’s first drive-thru bank
branch as well as GOLD to go – the region’s first-ever in-bank
gold vending machine. It also has the proud distinction of
having the UAE’s largest bank branch, covering almost 4,000
square metres.</p>
<p>The Bank’s first overseas venture was Al Hilal Bank
Kazakhstan, which is the first Islamic bank in Kazakhstan.
Furthermore, Al Hilal Global Sukuk Fund, its first global ‘sukuk’
fund, invests in the publicly-traded stocks of companies that
meet stringent Sharia-compliance standards, while Al Hilal
GCC Equity Fund reinforced the focus on companies closer
to home.</p>

    <img src="images/hilalbank-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
    <p>Al Hilal has been commended at the highest platforms in
the regional banking sector. These include “Best Customer Experience” at the 2008 Middle East Retail Banking Awards,
“Best Retail Bank (GCC)” at the Islamic Business & Finance
Awards (2010 and 2011), and “Best Branch Design” at the
Banker Middle East Product Awards (2011). It was also rated
four percent higher on the Ethos benchmark survey of 11
UAE banks, and was rated the most improved bank out of 28
national and international banks in the UAE.</p>
<p>Today, Al Hilal ranks 10th in the highly competitive UAE
market shared with 56 other banks and first in Kazakhstan.
The Islamic bank currently provides Personal, Corporate,
Treasury, Investment, and Wholesale banking services to
more than 50,000 customers. It operates 22 branches and
over 114 ATMS across the UAE. Continuing its growth, it
aims to solidify itself as a key player in affluent and midlarge
corporate segments using an organic strategy, while
remaining alert for the international opportunities that fit
the strategic direction.</p>

   <b>Pioneering Islamic banking in Kazakhstan</b>
        
<p>Kazakhstan is one of the few countries in the world, which has adopted a law on the establishment and development
of Islamic finance. Buoyed by this reality and encouraged by the friendly relationship between the governments of
the UAE and Kazakhstan, Al Hilal chose this nation for its maiden international presence.
As a result, it established the first Islamic bank in Kazakhstan as a fully-owned subsidiary, Al Hilal Bank Kazakhstan
in the year 2010. Initially, it faces key challenges experienced in adapting to a different regulatory environment,
macroeconomic variables and a new banking landscape. However, gaining quick insights on aspects of the
regulatory requirements for Islamic banking presence, economies and relevant market knowledge, it continued
marching forward.</p>
<p>The result was a lasting link with various customers, sustained by continuous monitoring and reviewing of the
market, regulations and economy. Currently, Al Hilal Bank is the leading Islamic bank in Kazakhstan, operating
three branches in strategic locations. It is ensuring that it stands true to its mission, which is to contribute to
Kazakhstan’s growth and prosperity, support the growth of Islamic banking in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), and create value for stakeholders. Showcasing the UAE’s confidence in its abilities, it has also been
tasked with facilitating the nation’s investment in Kazakhstan.</p>

        <p>Union National Bank (UNB) was established in 1982
with the emergence of the economic renaissance of
the UAE. Being one of the oldest well-established banks in
the region, the bank has gradually grown in terms of market
share and shareholder value as the national economy rose
in a whole. Since UNB is a Public Joint Stock Company, it is
40% owned by the public. It is also noteworthy to mention
that UNB is the only bank in the UAE with significant
shareholdings from both Abu Dhabi and Dubai governments.</p>
<p>Achieving milestones in the banking sector is not a
straightforward way, a philosophy that UNB always believes
on. Thus, UNB is always keen to have a diversified business
structure by providing a variety of products and services,
addressing needs ranging from basic requirements of
individuals to the more complex requirements of corporate
entities.</p>

<p>UNB continues its remarkable achievements in the
banking sector across the region. In 2008, the bank was
permitted to operate in Qatar Financial Centre (QFC)
offering services like accepting deposits and providing and
arranging credit facilities within QFC to wholesale customers.
This unique status is added to UNB’s successes since no other
bank from the UAE has achieved this in the Qatari financial
market. Within this year, the bank is also expected to establish its legal presence in Kuwait after receiving a license
to operate in 2011. Selecting these two countries reflects the
wise vision of its management team since Qatar and Kuwait
are among the fastest growing economies in the region.</p>
<p>Reinforcing its successes in becoming a major player in
the regional syndications market, UNB participated as a lead
arranger in a SAR 8.5 billion contract financing for Jeddahbased
Saudi bin Laden Group (SBG), to support SBG’s
recent contract relating to the expansion of King Abdul Aziz
International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Realizing the potential growth in vibrant trading and
large-populated destinations, UNB took its success overseas
within the region and established a presence in the Egyptian
banking sector through its acquisition of the Alexandria
Commercial and Maritime Bank during the year 2006. Within
a short span of time, the bank began spreading its wings
with 22 branches spanning Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said and
Suez. UNB is looking forward to enhance its network in the
Egyptian market by opening six more branches.</p>
<p>Away from the GCC, the bank stepped into the giant
dragon market by securing China Banking Regulatory
Commission approval to set up a representative office in
Shanghai in 2008, being the first bank from the region to do
so. </p> 
<p>UNB has also established two key subsidiaries that
provide services complementing its banking operations. The
first, Union Brokerage Company (UBC), one of the oldest
brokerage firms in the UAE, is a leading player in the sector. As one of the first national companies to deal in this field, it
created a well-diversified branch network across the nation.
In 2008, UBC received a General Clearing License from the
Nasdaq Dubai Exchange licensing it to provide clearance on
all listings on the same exchange, and in so doing, became
the only entity outside of the Western Hemisphere to hold
such a privileged license.</p>

    <p>The bank’s second subsidiary, Al Wifaq Finance Company,
was established to offer Sharia’a-compliant financial,
commercial and investing services. With the growing demand
for Islamic products in the nation from both organizations
and individuals, the company proved to be a key player
through stringent compliance with Sharia’a principles.</p>
<p>In the UAE, UNB operates through a wide network of over
50 branches and over 150 ATMs and, in 2002, became the first
bank of its size in the Middle East to receive an ISO 9001:2000
certification. This was awarded for its entire operations by
Lloyds Register Quality Assurance under the terms set out
by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS). In
2009, Union Brokerage Company (UBC) became the first
brokerage company in the Middle East to receive the ISO
9001:2008 certification and in the same year, UNB became
the first ISO 9001:2008 certified bank in the region. Union
National Bank’s (UNB) commitment to quality is reflected in
its continued financial successes over the years, which have
also made it the employer of choice for professionals from
the world over. It has created a strong culture of continual
performance improvement.</p>

   <b>Success Story 1</b>
        
<p>
remains one of the most distinguished UAE-based
global investors. The company was founded in 2005 when the
Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) privatized
its power and water assets. Even though the company has
significantly grown in a remarkable fast pace and stepped into
five different continents – North America, Europe, Africa and
Asia, retaining its position as the premier energy company in
the home market remains of such immense importance.
Today, TAQA is responsible for 98% of the emirate’s water
and electricity needs. In total, it owns seven plants in the UAE,
producing nearly 10,783 mega watts of power and 787 million
imperial gallons of water a day of desalination capacity. With
a combined total of over USD 23.4 billion in assets, TAQA
enjoys a stable fiscal position, which does not only enable
the company to operate with confidence but also to expand
regionally and globally.</p>
