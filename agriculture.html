        <p>Young and ambitious are two qualities that perfectly
represent the essence of Al Dahra Agriculture. Since
its inception in 1995, it has witnessed unmatched growth in
terms of geographic footprint, product and service offering
development and customer base expansion. In less than two
decades, the company has transformed from a local Abu
Dhabi-based company to a multinational organisation with
presence across four continents. It has also shifted from a
local mandate focused on private farming operations, to an
international mindset committed to growing the commercial
agricultural business.</p>
<p>Al Dahra’s leadership vision and organizational strategy
revolves around ensuring food security and sustainability
to the UAE and the host countries where it has invested.
Foreign investments in agriculture not only boost domestic
food supply, but also offer numerous benefits to local
populations. In turn, by making such investments, Al Dahra
is able to generate sufficient supply to meet its government
contracts needs and commercial activity in various markets.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/aldahra-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Al Dahra’s main line of business consists of farming,
production and supply of human and animal food. The
company has made considerable investments after being
awarded a number of government contracts to establish
a solid platform for the supply of forage and essential
commodities to the UAE. Consequently, Al Dahra acquired
a number of internationally-renowned producers of forage such as ACX Pacific Northwest in the United States of
America, in addition to Desagro, Soyn, Alfapla and Fagavi in
Spain.</p>
	
<p>Furthermore, Al Dahra has established production plants
for super Basmati rice in Pakistan under the brand name
of Brukfield and currently has more than 120 international
distributors in various countries around the world. In Egypt,
the company has set up large cultivation and production
operations for corn, potatoes, citrus fruits and alfalfa with a wide local and regional customer base. Its other significant
investments as part of the company’s portfolio include
plantation of olives in Moroccos and dates in Namibia; the
latter project being the driver behin winning the Khalifa
International Date Palm Award for two consecutive years,
2009 and 2010. The company aims to add sugar, wheat and
flour production to its product range in the near future. </p>
<p>Closer to home, keeping its commitment towards a
healthier society in the UAE, Al Dahra farms in Al Ain offer the finest fruits and vegetables,
which are fresh and organically
produced. In terms of dairy and
animal production, Al Dahra
has 3,300 milk producing cows
and 3,500 sheep as well as milk
and organic cheese production
plants, and is main supplier of
dairy products to dairy companies
in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. The
company’s accolades include
winning the Khalifa International
Date Palm Award for two
consecutive years, 2009 and 2010.</p>


<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/aldahra-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p> Al Dahra started the year 2013
on a highly positive note with the
signing of a preliminary agreement
with the Serbian Government
for agricultural development in
Serbia worth 300 million Euros
for long-term food security of the
UAE. This marks the beginning of
joint investment in eight Serbian
farming companies, upgrading
of agricultural infrastructure and irrigation systems as well
as acquiring new agricultural machineries and technologies.
This will also result in developing of existing agricultural
lands for the cultivation of various crops like wheat, barley,
corn and forage (alfalfa), among others, over an area of
about 14,000 hectares of owned and leased land.</p>
    
    <p>The intended aim of this move is to meet Abu Dhabi’s
vision and strategy for long-term food security. While a share
of the crops production will be supplied to the UAE market,
another share will be dedicated for local consumption in
Serbia and for marketing and trading on the international
market, thereby enabling progress for both the nations.</p>

<div id="co_img">
    <img src="images/aldahra-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Besides the considerable investments in farming and
production, Al Dahra has also made investments in logistics
to ensure quality across its entire supply chain, including state-of-the-art warehousing facilities, local distribution fleet
and building long-term relationships with sea freight vessel
operators. It is also finalising the plans to build a regional
commodities’ hub in the new Abu Dhabi port (Khalifa Port)
coupled with a massive off-shore investment in the free zone
(KIZAD) for re-export of raw and finished food products.</p>
<p>Whilst the United Arab Emirates remains at the core of
its strategy, the company is well-positioned to become one
of the key international players in the agriculture sector
and a leader in the food supply chain business. Al Dahra
Agriculture has operations in 8 countries worldwide, forming
a significant presence in this sector. Currently, it is in the
process of finalising its market entry strategy into Argentina,
Australia, Greece and Romania amongst other target growth
territories.</p>

   <b>Partner for a rich harvest in Pakistan</b>
        
<p>Al Dahra’s association with Pakistan commenced
in 2007 with the undertaking of a project in the
Sindh district. The principal aim of this project was
to grow alfalfa and Rhodes grass for export to the
UAE, while enabling further innovation and growth
in this sector in the region. Buoyed by the initial
success, it chose six new locations, covering an
area of 5,000 acres, while exploring new avenues
by setting up a fully-equipped rice factory for the
production, polishing, packing and distribution of
high quality Basmati Rice.</p>
<p>In addition, the company also formed Brukfield
Rice, a joint business enterprise headquartered
in Karachi. The company has grown stronger
by cultivating long-standing relationships with
farmers, which goes a long way in procuring
quality produce at reasonable prices, thereby
benefiting both the buyer and the seller. Today,
it is a leading rice exporter from Pakistan with
a network that spans almost every continent
worldwide, becoming a key example of Al Dahra
Agriculture’s contribution to sustainable and longterm
development.</p>

   <b>Cultivating growth in Spain and the UAE</b>
        
<p>Planning a move into a key European market, Al Dahra
Agriculture chose Spain, which is one of the largest
countries of Western Europe in terms of land mass.
As part of this strategic plan, the company acquired
Fagavi, an established name and one of the experts in
the market, for the purchase and distribution of highquality
fodder.</p>
<p>With a strategic location in Bujaraloz, Zaragoza,
favorable climate conditions for the growing of forage,
advanced technology and vast product offering and
capabilities in terms of bales and pellets’ production,
Al Dahra Fagavi is positioned to be the largest forage
producer in Europe. In addition, the company has
forged over the past years excellent relations with the
port of Barcelona giving it an edge when it comes to
the export and trading of its products internationally.</p>
<p>Al Dahra Fagavi operates about 12,000 acres of leased
land in Spain and has multiple production factories
in various provinces. The current annual production
capacity of Al Dahra Fagavi is 700,000 metric tons
with ongoing investemts to increase production.
The company further employs very stringent quality
control measures and standards ensuring cultivation
and production of the highest quality end-products.
Recognising its efficient management system, Fagavi
was awarded the ISO 9001:2008 in June 2010, adding
yet another milestone to Al Dahra Agriculture’s
journey.</p>

it specializes in the grains, oils and proteins and pulses,
providing agricultural raw materials to manufacturers and
traders of foods, bio-fuels and feed across the MENA region,
Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Many factors have contributed to the success of Al Ghurair
Resources. Being a member of Al Ghurair conglomerate,
holding an extensive knowledge in trade and manufacturing
processes and 40 years of combined experience and being
strategically located in the global-central-Dubai are a
few elements that enabled Al Ghurair Resources to grow
and expand geographically and in every segment of this

<p>As a major supply chain provider of different grains
including wheat, maize, oats and barley, Al Ghurair Resources
has been able to secure a continuous supply of superior raw
materials to the highly demanding Gulf region. In the last
few years, the company has witnessed a tremendous growth
(15-20 per cent year on year growth rate). This was mainly
due to the increasing demand from the Gulf countries as they are developing buffer stocks as a part of their food security
programs. As a result, the company’s turnover has grown to
AED 6 billion in 2013.</p>
<p>Al Ghurair Resources has secured storage facilities in
Lebanon with a capacity of 15,000 (MT) and Sudan with a
capacity of 80,000 MT.</p>
<p>As a part of its expansion plan, Al Ghurair Resources
is also investing USD 40 million in grain storage facilities
(160,000-tonne grain silo) in Algeria. Silos are also being built
in Libya and rented in Egypt. These investments come in line
with company’s vision of becoming the number-one supplier
of grains in the region, thus providing a continuous supply for
governments’ food security silos. </p> 
<p>In addition to grains storage capacities, Al Ghurair
Resources built a state-of-the-art oils and proteins processing
plant in that produces premium quality oils for a vast number
of applications from industrial to nutritional and beyond.</p>
<p>Al Ghurair Resources specializes in crushing canola,
soybeans and sunflower seeds. It supplies vegetable oils to
the biodiesel industry in Europe as well cater to the demands for human consumption in the Middle East and South East
Asia. Oil meals are exported worldwide for animal nutrition
industry. With a crushing capacity of 4500 million tons a day
for soybeans and 3200 MT/day for rapeseeds, Al Ghurair
Resources’ plant has become one of the largest plants for
rapeseed crushing in the world - at one location.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    <p>Al Ghurair’s refinery, strategically located in the Jebel
Ali Port, has an annual refining capacity of 96,000 MT. It
refines and packs canola, corn, sunflower oils. In addition to
its own brands, it supplies edible oils to retailers, HORECA,
wholesalers and private labels.</p>
<p>In line with its expansion strategy of stepping into long
term sustainable projects, Al Ghurair Resources is also
investing USD 10 million to build a plant for the production
of lecithin, an oil by-product, in the UAE. Lecithin is used
in bakeries and for animal feed. It is obtained from the
double refining of oils at the Dubai Oil Mills crushing plant.
By stepping into the different segments of oils processing,
the company is heading at the right direction of securing its
leading global role.</p>

   <b>Supplying the World with Canola Oil</b>
        
<p>With an investment of AED 250 million, Al Ghurair
established Dubai Oil Mills, the flagship unit of Al
Ghurair Resources, in 2001 as the largest producer
of edible oil and protein meal in the region. Dubai
Oil Mills, the largest single-line crushing plant in
the world, has a crushing capacity 4,500 tonnes of
quality soybean or 3,200 tonnes of quality canola
seeds per day. As a result, Dubai Oil Mills has
become one of the major soybean and canola oil
suppliers not only to the region but also to the world.</p>
<p>Over the past six years, Dubai Oil Mills has been able
to expand its sales in 15 countries. The company
crushed its 2 millionth canola seed in 2010. In a
strategic move to enhance the crushing capacity of
canola seeds, Al Ghurair Resources – in a strategic
partnership with the Edible Oils Company – has
increased canola crushing capacity to over 1.5 million
metric tonnes a year.</p>

        <p>Date palms have been an intrinsic part of Arab life and
heritage for time immemorial. Across the ages, it has
been used for a multitude of necessities right from shelter
amidst the harsh desert landscapes for consumption as a
nutritious food. Arab Bedouins settled in palm oases, and
made use of all parts of the tree and its fruit. Showcasing the
UAE’s ample resources of this cherished commodity is the
fact that the nation is one of the top 10 date palm cultivators
in the world.</p>
<p>Al Foah was established as a palm development company
as per the industrial diversification policy of the UAE through
an Emirate of Abu Dhabi Executive Council Resolution in
2005. It is a member of the Abu Dhabi-based SENAAT, one
of the largest industrial conglomerates in the UAE, which
establishes private joint stock companies in large-scale,
capital-intensive industries.</p>
<p>Al Foah was formed with an aim to take this product into
the new millennium and throughout the modern world. It is a
pioneer in bringing new agricultural science and technology
to growing and harvesting this traditional, popular food.
While working towards establishing a world-class sector for
dates, the company also contributes positively to the UAE’s
social development on solid economic foundations.</p>

<p>The company started out by bringing established date
farms under a single umbrella to better meet the needs and
address the demands of this sector. Through its facilities,
strategy and focus, the company has emerged as the largest
date procuring and processing company in the UAE. Working
towards establishing a global identity, it exports 90 percent
of the dates it procures from UAE farmers.</p> 
<p>One of its key achievements was raising productivity of
the factories from 30,000 tonnes in 2005 to 74,000 tonnes in
2008, thereby increasing sales revenue by 170 percent during
3 years. Al Foah has always placed emphasis on maintaining
the best standards and adheres to ISO and HACCP quality
systems and has also signed a MOU with the Environment
Friends Society (EFS).</p>
<p>The company also places emphasis on employing UAE

In addition, it prioritises support to its 17,000 UAE farmers
by guiding and providing them with a variety of capabilities
and services.</p>

processing facilities; The Emirates Dates Factory at Al Saad
which was established in 1998 has an annual capacity of
65,000 tonnes of dates. The Al Marfa Dates Factory which
was established in 1994 has an annual capacity exceeding
25,000 tonnes of dates.</p>

        <p>As Dubai gears itself for becoming a hub for Islamic
economy, it is starting well ahead of the rest as the
home to leading Islamic financial institutions and Halal food
brands. The UAE has always been led by the vision to balance
modernity and progress with culture and heritage, which is
evidenced in the pioneering concepts based on Islamic tenets
that it has upheld and promoted globally.</p>
<p>One name that has continued to be a pioneering name
in this field is that of Hajj Saeed Bin Ahmad Lootah, who
not only founded the UAE’s largest Islamic bank, but also
pioneered the Co-operative movement in the UAE, followed
by Halal food production. The journey of Al Islami Foods in
food production and distribution started way back in 1970
with a small grocery store in Deira, Dubai. In the first decade,
the company increased its size by adding new outlets
throughout the UAE. It was in the year 1981 that it decided
to step ahead by establishing its own brand “Al Islami” with a
goal to make Real Halal food available in the UAE and beyond.</p>
<p>As a result of its success in food distribution and after
gaining consumer confidence and trust, Al Islami Foods built
its own food processing plant in Jebel Ali, Dubai in 1992.
The state-of-the-art facility has the capacity to produce 25
tonnes of Sharia’a-compliant processed meat on a daily basis.
Al Islami Foods has also added various fast food restaurant
chains and butcher shops to diversify its portfolio and to
distribute its products, the prominent among these being Al
Farooj.</p>

<p>By coordinating Islamic supervision on all meat products
imported from outside the UAE, Al Islami quickly gained
the trust of millions of consumers through its first product
line - frozen chicken - across the UAE and the Gulf. The first
consignment of Al Islami chicken was exported to Denmark. Through successive growth ventures, Al Islami Foods
managed to enlarge its product range and reach in different
countries; beef and lamb in Australia, cheese and processed
meat in Denmark, soup and jelly in Norway, and others.</p>
<p>In order to create a stronger presence and met growing
demands in Europe, Al Islami recently entered new markets;
the UK in 2007 and France in 2010. Following its impressive
expansion in European countries, Al Islami expanded its
operations in GCC countries. </p> 
<p>The distribution of luncheon meat in Denmark highlights
a turning point in Al Islami’s successful journey. Danish
Scientists analysed Al Islami products to ascertain that they
did not contain any pork extracts, as traces had been found in
several products from companies in the Middle East region.
Technical teams from Denmark and Holland carried out
European Union regulated tests. When all the brands except
Al Islami tested positive for traces of pork, it reinforced the
fast that the brand placed paramount emphasis on quality
and purity.</p>
<p>To acknowledge the superior quality of the produce
exported to European countries, its consistent
conscientiousness was recognised with an award for the best luncheon meat. Al Islami has also received awards from
Spain and Germany for Best Food Quality. In addition, it
recently won the introduced 腺est Quality Halal Award・at the
Gulfood expo. And locally, it was awarded with recognition
for the best and cleanest factory for its food processing plant
in Jebel Ali. Consequently, Al Islami achieved 賎rade A・meat
recognition and met all international standards, which paved
the way towards its strong presence in the food industry.</p>

   <b>Taste that succeeds with regional values</b>
        
<p>In the year 2007, Al Islami Foods decides to venture beyond just food
production into the growing hospitality sector. Seeking a business that
matched its Sharia’s-compliance principles, it acquired the Al Farooj
group of restaurants and merged it into Al Islami Hospitality business unit.</p>
<p>Al Farooj, which was established in the year 1994, to offer authentic
char-grilled chicken in Sharjah had become renowned as restaurant that
offered quality and freshness from day one. It quickly grew its fame by
offering shawerma, the famed Arabian snack, in two unique varieties
-Mexican and Italian - following it up with further additions to its menu.</p>
<p>2007 was a turning point for the Al Farooj chain, as Al Islami propelled
it with an aggressive expansion plan and by September 2012, its total
number of outlets reached 40 spanning not just across the UAE, but in
Lebanon, Kuwait, Libya and France. Today, Al Farooj is set on a path
of success leading it beyond the region to global metropolises as a
multinational food and beverage company with Arabian roots.</p>

The capital city of the UAE, Abu Dhabi, consistently
invests in developing cutting-edge food security
infrastructure and management programmes. These
initiatives are in line with its long-term commitment to
shape and drive the nation’s leading role in maintaining food
security regionally. In this scenario, Agthia Group PJSC plays
a major role through its well-established, high-quality local
and regional brands combined with newer, leading global
brands. Together, these characterise Agthia’s attractive and
unique product portfolio, one that is trusted by customers
and consumers regionally.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi, where the company is headquartered and
listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), also
houses Agthia’s main production and distribution facilities.</p>
<p>It was incorporated as part of Abu Dhabi government’s
privatisation process, undertaken to revitalise industry in
an increasingly diversified and rapidly developing economy.
Agthia is a unique company as many of its brands existed
long before it was incorporated. Grand Mills and Al Ain Water
were established by the UAE’s late President, His Highness
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in 1978 and 1990
respectively, to fulfil an important part of the newly-formed
nation’s objective of providing food security to its people in
the areas of grains, animal feed and water.</p>

<p>Agthia is driven by the aim to be recognised as UAE’s
best food & beverage, and constantly endeavours to deliver
superior value to stakeholders by bringing innovative and
trusted products in line with emerging health and wellness
needs. It operates in a reliable, efficient and profitable
manner, as a partner of choice. The company achieves
organisational excellence through a corporate culture that 
fosters commitment, teamwork, entrepreneurship and
achievement, making it an employer of choice. Furthermore,
it places equal emphasis on socially-responsible and
environmentally-friendly practices. Its production units
hold ISO 22000 accreditation in food safety management,
certified by Lloyds Register Quality Assurance, as well as
HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) approval. </p> 
<p>Its focus on continued marketing investment is aimed at
building and consolidating brand equity while driving sales
and volume growth, geographic expansion and enhanced
profitability. Agthia’s portfolio of brands is categorised in
four food & beverage divisions: flour & animal feed, water &
beverages, processed fruits & vegetables and dairy.</p>
<p>As a UAE-based company, it has benefited from the
nation’s investments in business infrastructure, logistics,
transportation and progressive labour policies, helping local
businesses grow and compete at regional and international
levels. Starting with Grand Mills and Al Ain Mineral Water
brands, Agthia has established itself as a leading food
& beverage company in the UAE. It has also focused on
strategic diversification and geographical expansion through
internationally-renowned brands like Capri-Sun, Chiquita
and Yoplait, as well as home-made brands like Al Ain Veg, Al
Ain Fresh, Pure Natural and Wow.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, Agthia has always seen regional
and international expansion as a key part of its strategic plan
to achieve its vision of becoming a regional leader in the food
& beverages industry. Its Egypt Business was inaugurated
in June 2009 and represented Agthia’s first international expansion. The move was aimed at raising existing capacity
of processing fresh tomato into tomato concentrate, to
capitalise on an opportunity to export to international
markets in the fast-growing tomato paste and frozen
vegetable categories. Today, Agthia’s Egypt business brands
include Al Ain, targeting B2B and export business, and Pure
Natural, targeting retail Egyptian market.</p>

    </div><!-- co_img -->
    
<p>Prior to that, in early 2008, it partnered with Capri-Sun
for the production and distribution of its juice products
in the GCC. In just 9 months, it had the factory ready to
start production, a move that marked its first international
production and distribution step in the GCC. This made it a
partner of choice for the world’s number 1 kid’s drink and
number 3 in juice drinks in the world, with presence in over
163 countries.</p>
<p>In 2011, it joined hands with Chiquita Brands LLC, USA,
to manufacture and distribute a range of natural fruit juice
products in the UAE, the GCC, Levant and Egypt. In the same
year, it also launched Yoplait, the world’s second largest fresh
dairy brand, products in the UAE. Continuing its growth, in
2012, Agthia further expanded geographically into Turkey, by
acquiring a Turkey-based spring water brand.</p>
<p>Agthia’s journey, since its establishment, has been one
of sustainable growth and innovation, leading the group
into the vibrant, forward-looking company that currently
employs close to 1,900 employees across four business
divisions. As per full year 2012 unaudited results, its net sales
grow 16% year on year to AED 1.33 billion, while net profit of
AED 125 million grow by 44% year on year.</p>

   <b>Bringing nature’s purity from Turkey to the world</b>
        
<p>International expansion comes with numerous challenges including building an understanding of the market and
business environment, attracting new talent, maintaining standards across regions and forging new business
relationships. Agthia, buoyed by the UAE’s excellent international relationships and the company’s network
of regional business contacts as well as manufacturing expertise has always succeeded in overcoming these
challenges.</p>
<p>Agthia’s Turkey business division, established in late December 2011, through the acquisition of a spring water
company situated in Adana, South of Turkey, marked its second international expansion. The source of this spring
water originates from the renowned Toros Mountains. The brand, Alpin natural spring water, originates from a
spring that has served and continues to serve many local generations. At present, its distribution plans span not
just Turkey and the UAE, but the wider GCC and beyond.</p>
